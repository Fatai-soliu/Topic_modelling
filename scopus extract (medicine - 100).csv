To establish whether knowledge of the estimated normally hydrated weight from bioimpedance measurements (BI-NHW) when setting the post-hemodialysis target weight (TW) might mitigate rate of loss of RKF, we undertook an open label, randomized controlled trial in incident patients receiving HD, with clinicians and patients blinded to bioimpedance readings in controls. A total of 439 patients with over 500 ml urine/day or residual GFR exceeding 3 ml/min/1.73m2 were recruited from 34 United Kingdom centers and randomized 1:1, stratified by center. Fluid assessments were made for up to 24 months using a standardized proforma in both groups, supplemented by availability of BI-NHW in the intervention group. Primary outcome was time to anuria, analyzed using competing-risk survival models adjusted for baseline characteristics, by intention to treat. Secondary outcomes included rate of RKF decline (mean urea and creatinine clearance), blood pressure and patient-reported outcomes. There were no group differences in cause-specific hazard rates of anuria (0.751; 95% confidence interval (0.459, 1.229)) or sub-distribution hazard rates (0.742 (0.453, 1.215)). RKF decline was markedly slower than anticipated, pooled linear rates in year 1: –0.178 (–0.196, –0.159)), year 2: –0.061 (–0.086, –0.036)) ml/min/1.73m2/month. Blood pressure and patient-reported outcomes did not differ by group. The mean difference agreement between TW and BI-NHW was similar for both groups, Bioimpedance: –0.04 kg; Control: –0.25 kg. Thus, use of a standardized clinical protocol for fluid assessment when setting TW is associated with excellent preservation of RKF. Hence, bioimpedance measurements are not necessary to achieve this. © 2023 International Society of Nephrology",anuria; bioimpedance spectroscopy; blood pressure; fluid status; patient-reported outcomes; residual kidney function,Medicine,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus
Preece S.J.; Alghamdi W.; Jones R.K.,Individuals with knee osteoarthritis demonstrate increased passive stiffness of the hip flexor muscles,Knee,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150448083&doi=10.1016%2fj.knee.2023.01.007&partnerID=40&md5=7ce8e1cebdc2c5523560d870e7fbff51,"Background: People with knee osteoarthritis stand and walk with increased trunk flexion. This altered postural alignment increases hamstring activation, elevating mechanical knee loads during walking. Increased hip flexor stiffness may lead to increased trunk flexion. Therefore, this study compared hip flexor stiffness between healthy individuals and individuals with knee osteoarthritis. This study also sought to understand the biomechanical effect of a simple instruction to reduce trunk flexion by 5° during walking. Methods: Twenty individuals with confirmed knee osteoarthritis and 20 healthy individuals participated. The Thomas test was used to quantity passive stiffness of the hip flexor muscles and three-dimensional motion analysis used to quantify trunk flexion during normal walking. Using a controlled biofeedback protocol, each participant was then instructed to decrease trunk flexion by 5°. Results: Passive stiffness was greater in the group with knee osteoarthritis (effect size = 1.04). For both groups, there was relatively strong correlation between passive stiffness and trunk flexion in walking (r = 0.61–0.72). The instruction to decrease trunk flexion produced only small, non-significant, reductions in hamstring activation during early stance. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate that individuals with knee osteoarthritis exhibit increased passive stiffness of the hip muscles. This increased stiffness appears to be linked to increased trunk flexion and may therefore underlie the increased hamstring activation which is associated with this disease. As simple postural instruction does not appear to reduce hamstring activity, interventions may be required which can improve postural alignment by reducing passive stiffness of the hip muscles. © 2023",Gait; Hip flexor; Knee osteoarthritis; Thomas test; Trunk flexion; Trunk inclination,Medicine,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

Affected lymphocytic cells can affect the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, bone marrow, and rarely other organs. Spontaneous rupture of the spleen is a rare health condition, with a few cases caused by CLL. Since the preliminary presentation of either impending or real splenic rupture is unusual and requires recording and reporting, this case report was developed. Case report: A 55-year-old male patient presented with a significant weight loss of 20 kg, loss of appetite, fatigue, abdominal pain, and early satiety. Clinical examination revealed massive splenomegaly 22 cm below the costal margin, otherwise unremarkable on systemic examination. The size and dimensions of the spleen were confirmed by computed tomography of the body. The patient underwent a bone marrow biopsy, which was suggestive of atypical CLL. Due to the rapid progression of the size of the spleen and the pattern of impending rupture of the spleen, an emergency splenectomy was performed, and the histopathological report confirmed low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, mostly typical of CLL. Conclusion: Given the rarity of cases, continuous data recording and reporting is required to enrich the scientific literature and share experiences from case to case. This will create a complete picture of this health condition across diverse regions and countries. © 2023",Chronic lymphocytic leukemia; Mantel lymphoma; Non-Hodgkin lymphoma; Splenic marginal zone lymphoma; Splenic rupture,Medicine,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Scopus

Secondary stressors can exacerbate them, and social support can provide mitigation and aid recovery. There is a need to better understand distress and mitigating factors among survivors of the Manchester Arena attack in 2017. Aims: We explored three questions. First, what experiences of distress did participants report? Second, how might secondary stressors have influenced participants' psychosocial recoveries? Third, what part has social support played in the relationships between distress and participants' recovery trajectories? Method We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of a convenience sample of survivors of the Manchester Arena bombing (N = 84) in January 2021 (3 years 8 months post-incident), and a longitudinal study of the same participants' scores on mental health measures over 3 years from September 2017. Results: Survivors' mental well-being scores in early 2021 were significantly lower than general population norms. Longitudinal follow-up provided evidence of enduring distress. Secondary stressors, specifically disruptions to close relationships, were associated with greater post-event distress and slower recovery. We found an indirect relationship between identifying with, and receiving support from, others present at the event and mental well-being >3 years later. Conclusions: The Arena attack has had an enduring impact on mental health, even in survivors who had a mild response to the event. The quality of close relationships is pivotal to long-term outcome. Constructive support from family and friends, and people with shared experiences, are key to social cure processes that facilitate coping and recovery.

Methods: The model consisted of a 90-day decision tree followed by a lifetime cohort Markov model. Efficacy data were taken from a network meta-analysis and published literature, while cost, utility and mortality data were taken from published literature. A treatment sequence was defined as a first-line intervention or a different second-line intervention, and used constant third- and fourth-line interventions. The possible first- and second-line interventions were vancomycin, metronidazole, teicoplanin and fidaxomicin (standard and extended regimens). Total costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated and were used to run a fully incremental cost-effectiveness analysis. Threshold analysis was conducted around pricing. Results: Sequences including teicoplanin, fidaxomicin (extended regimen) and second-line metronidazole were excluded based on recommendations from the committee. The final pairwise comparison was between first-line vancomycin and second-line fidaxomicin (VAN-FID), and the reverse (FID-VAN). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for FID-VAN compared with VAN-FID was £156,000 per QALY gained, and FID-VAN had a 0.2% likelihood of being cost effective at a £20,000 threshold. Conclusion: First-line vancomycin and second-line fidaxomicin was the most cost-effective treatment sequence at the NICE threshold for treating CDI in England. The main limitation of this study was that the initial cure and recurrence rates of each intervention were applied constantly across each line of treatment and each round of recurrence. © 2023, The Author(s).",,Medicine,Adis,Article,Scopus
Skidmore S.; Prior Y.; Nester C.; Bird S.; Vasilica C.,"Where do you stand?: an exploration of perspectives toward feet, foot health, and footwear using innovative digital methods",Journal of Foot and Ankle Research,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85156224490&doi=10.1186%2fs13047-023-00621-3&partnerID=40&md5=4be24d8261f7a16859585b1444272c02,"Background: The cost of losing foot health is significant to the person, healthcare systems, and economy, with diabetes related foot health issues alone costing over £1 billion annually in the UK. Yet many foot health problems are preventable through alternative health behaviour. It is therefore important to understand how feet, foot health and footwear are conceptualised to gain understanding about how these might influence foot health behaviour and inform health messages that seek to protect or improve foot health through altered health behaviour. This research seeks to explore attitudes and beliefs and identify phenomena that may act as barriers or motivators to the proactive self-management of foot health. Methods: Public conversations involving 2,699 expressions related to feet, footwear or foot health on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram were extracted. Conversations on Facebook and Twitter were scraped with NVivo’s NCapture plugin whereby data is extracted and downloaded to NVivo. Extracted files were uploaded to the Big Content Machine (software developed at the University of Salford) which facilitated the search for keywords ‘foot’, ‘feet’, ‘footwear’, ‘shoe’, and ‘shoes’. Instagram was scraped by hand. Data was analysed using a Thematic Analysis approach. Results: Three themes were identified; 1) connections and disconnections derived from social and cultural constructs, 2) phenomena beyond attitudes and beliefs that relate to symbolic representations and the impact when foot health is lost, and 3) phenomena relating to Social Media as a conduit for the exploration of attitudes and beliefs. Conclusions: This novel research exemplifies complex and sometimes incongruous perspectives about feet including their value for what they facilitate, contrasted with negative feelings about the negative impact that can have aesthetically when feet work hard. Sometimes feet were devalued, with expressions of disgust, disconnection, and ridicule. The importance of contextual, social, and cultural phenomena with implications for optimising foot health messages. Knowledge gaps including factors related to children’s foot health and development, and how to treat foot health problems. The power of communities with shared experience to influence decisions, theories, and behaviour about foot health was also revealed. While people do talk about feet in some social contexts, it is not always in a way that promotes overt, positive foot health behaviour. Finally, this research demonstrates the benefit of exploring perspectives in uncontrived settings and illuminates the potential utility of social media (SoMe) platforms Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter as vehicles to promote foot health self-management behaviour that is responsive to the social and demographic variances of engagers who inhabit those spaces. © 2023, The Author(s).",Attitudes; Beliefs; Feet; Foot health; Prevention,Medicine,BioMed Central Ltd,Article,Scopus

Carers support people with intellectual disabilities in many aspects including habitual shopping and preparation of food, but their own nutrition knowledge and the influence this may have on dietary intakes of clients is unknown. We explored the nutrition knowledge of carers of people with intellectual disabilities in residential care settings, their dietary habits and their influence on clients' food shopping and preparation and therefore the diet consumed by their clients. Ninety-seven carers belonging to a large independent care sector organisation specialising in the care of people with an intellectual disability completed a validated general nutrition knowledge and behaviour questionnaire. Seventeen carers from the residential care settings were interviewed to contextualise practice. Knowledge about key dietary recommendations scored highly. Carers who had more work experience were found to have higher scores in ‘making everyday food choices’ (p = 0.034). Daily consumption of fruit and vegetables (at least one portion per day) was observed (for fruit by 46% of the carers and for vegetables by 60% of the carers), whilst most carers reported avoiding consuming full-fat dairy products, sugary foods and fried foods. The concept of a healthy diet; typical dietary habits of clients; role in food acquisition; and training in nutrition emerged as themes from the interviews. Carers discussed various topics including the importance of a balanced diet, cooking fresh foods and control of food portion sizes for clients relative to the care philosophy of a client-centred approach, which encapsulates client autonomy. Gaps in knowledge around specific nutrients, making healthy choices and cooking skills remain. Carers have an influence on clients' dietary choices; they are able to provide healthy meals and share good dietary habits with clients. Further training in nutrition is recommended for impact on clients' health. © 2023 The Authors.

Changes to these activities can be accurately quantified using combined measurement. Using activPAL3 and self-reports to collect activity data, the study aimed to quantify changes that occurred in physical activity and sedentary behavior between prelockdown and lockdown. The study also sought to determine changes in indoor and outdoor stepping. Methods: Using activPAL3, four participants recorded physical activity data prelockdown and during lockdown restrictions (February–June 2020). Single events (sitting, standing, stepping, lying) were recorded and analyzed by the CREA algorithm using an event-based approach. The analysis focused on step count, sedentary time, and lying (in bed) time; median and interquartile range were calculated. Daily steps classified as taking place indoors and outdoors were calculated separately. Results: 33 prelockdown and 92 in-lockdown days of valid data were captured. Median daily step count across all participants reduced by 14.8% (from 5,828 prelockdown to 4,963 in-lockdown), while sedentary and lying time increased by 4% and 8%, respectively (sedentary: 9.98–10.30 hr; lying: 9.33–10.05 hr). Individual variations were observed in hours spent sedentary (001: 8.44–8.66, 002: 7.41–8.66, 003: 11.97–10.59, 004: 6.29–7.94, and lying (001: 9.69–9.49, 002: 11.46–11.66, 003: 7.63–9.34, 004: 9.7–11.12) pre-and in-lockdown. Discrepancies in self-report versus algorithm classification of indoor/outdoor stepping were observed for three participants. Conclusion: The study quantitively showed lockdown restrictions negatively impacted physical activity and sedentary behavior; two variables closely linked to health outcomes. This has important implications for public health policies to help develop targeted interventions and mandates that encourage additional physical activity and lower sedentary behavior. © 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.",activity monitor; lockdown; physical activity; sedentary,Medicine,Human Kinetics Publishers Inc.,Article,Scopus

Methods: Content validity was first investigated using cognitive debriefing interviews. Participants completed a postal questionnaire. Construct validity was assessed using Rasch analysis. Concurrent validity included testing between the RA-WIS and work (e.g., Workplace Activity Limitations Scale) and health (FM Impact Questionnaire-Revised (FIQ-R) scales. Two weeks later, participants were mailed a second questionnaire to measure test-retest reliability. Results: Interviews were conducted with 13 participants with FM. All RA-WIS items were considered very or extremely relevant by almost all participants, with only one suggesting other items (anxiety and brain fog). Questionnaire responses were analysed from 156 employed participants: 94% women; 45.71 (SD 10.05) years of age; with time since FM diagnosis 2.99 (4.17) years (symptom duration 8.36 (SD 7.16) years). The RA-WIS mostly satisfied Rasch model requirements and a Rasch transformation scale was created. Concurrent validity was generally good (rs = 0.55–0.66) with work scales and the FIQ-R. Internal consistency (Person Separation Index values) was consistent with group use in FM, not individual level use. Test-retest reliability was excellent, with intraclass coefficient (2, 1) = 0.90. Discussion: The RA-WIS is valid and reliable for group use in employed people with FM. However, further work is needed to develop a WIS for individual use in FM. © 2023 The Authors.

Methods: The three scales were adapted into British-English and reviewed by an expert panel prior to cognitive debriefing interviews. Participants completed postal questionnaires. Construct validity for the PWSS was assessed using Rasch analysis. Concurrent validity included testing between the three scales and work, job strain and work-life balance scales. Two weeks later, participants were mailed a second questionnaire to measure test-retest reliability. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 831 employed participants: 68% women, 53.50 (SD 8.9) years of age, with condition duration 7.70 (SD 8.00) years. The PWSS satisfied Rasch model requirements. Concurrent validity was mostly as hypothesised, that is, weak to moderate negative correlations for the PWSS (rs = 0.07 to −0.61), and weak to moderate positive correlations for the WABPPS and WTI (rs = 0.20–0.52). Some correlations were stronger, mostly in axSpA. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) for all three scales was consistent with group use in all conditions. Test-retest reliability was generally excellent, with intraclass coefficients (2,1) of 0.80–0.93 for the three scales in the four conditions.

Adunola T.B.,Leadership styles and their outcomes: a study of a Nigerian hospital middle management nurses,Leadership in Health Services,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141583191&doi=10.1108%2fLHS-05-2022-0058&partnerID=40&md5=c90ac930b8ceabc28e98eb7f2903428e,"Purpose: This study was conducted to identify and explore the leadership styles and the leadership outcomes of the middle management nurses in a large tertiary hospital in Ibadan, the capital of Oyo state of Nigeria. This study aims to explore and describe the perception of staff nurses (SNs) about their nurse managers’ (NMs) leadership styles, to investigate the leadership outcomes of NMs as perceived by their SNs and to investigate what are the best predictors of the leadership outcomes among the perceived leadership styles. Design/methodology/approach: Thirty-six variables of the MLQ-5X were compressed into the nine psychological constructs, as proposed by Avolio and Bass (2004). Four items of each of the nine sub-scales were combined together, to form the independent variables. The nine items of the leadership outcomes were compressed into three composite variables as: the Leader’s perceived influence as being effective in leading the group variable, it has four items; the Leader’s perceived influence as being satisfactory to the group being led variable, it has two items; and lastly, the Leader’s perceived influence to encourage the staff. Findings: When all the three leadership sub-scales were combined as one total leadership outcome, the regression analysis showed that four leadership constructs were the predictors of the leadership outcome, that is, idealized attribute (ß = 0.173, p = 0.011), intellectual stimulation (ß = 0.171, p = 0.016), individualized consideration (ß = 0.240, p = 0.001) and contingent reward (ß = 0.194, p = 0.006). The coefficients and the p-values of the remaining five leadership constructs are as shown in Table 1. Research limitations/implications: This study has many limitations. One, the respondents were not randomly sampled, so the results cannot be generalized outside of UCH, Nigeria. It is also a one-time survey. Practical implications: Managers who regularly practice transformational leadership (TFL) would be able to encourage their SNs to put in their best for the greater good of the organization. In this study, three sub-scales of the TFL, that is, idealized attribute, intellectual stimulation and individualized consideration were found to be strong predictors of leadership outcomes. Leaders who are able to treat their staff with care and concern for the individual, able to mentor, advise, coach and develop their staff are likely to also see improved staff satisfaction and extra effort in staff performance. This is especially necessary in sub-Saharan African countries, including Nigeria. Social implications: It is therefore strongly recommended that middle management nurses in UCH should continue to strive and improve on their TFL skills as well as their contingent reward styles of leadership. Vesterinen et al. (2012) said that NMs who can observe their own behaviour and its effects on employees can adjust to a better leadership style. In particular, individualized consideration skills such as coaching, mentoring, advising, developing and showing concern for the individual needs of their staff would encourage SNs to put in extra effort and be more satisfied with their leaders. Originality/value: To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is his original research work and it has never been published elsewhere. The whole work was however submitted for a PhD thesis to the University of Salford. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Leadership; Management development; Management effectiveness; Nurses; Transformational leadership,Medicine,Emerald Publishing,Article,Scopus

While this “carry-over” effect has been found across numerous experiments, past studies have utilised paradigms that present similar tasks to the same spatial location. The present research explored whether attentional settings persist in more dynamic situations. In Experiment 1, participants played a computer game that encouraged a horizontal, vertical, or random spread of search. After 10 or 30 s, they moved 90° to their right and monitored a driving video for hazards. Eye movements to the videos were not affected by the characteristics of the preceding game, revealing no carry-over of attentional settings. One possible explanation for this was the visuospatial shift between the tasks. To explore this further, Experiment 2 adopted a similar paradigm to previous research; participants searched horizontal, vertical, or random letter strings before completing an image search. In one block the tasks were presented to the same screen, and in one block the tasks were presented to different screens (incorporating a 90° visuospatial shift mid-trial). Carry-over was found in the one-screen block, with a significantly wider horizontal search and a narrower vertical search in the pictures after a horizontal letter search. However, there was no carry-over from the letter to the picture task in the two-screen block. This indicates the flexibility of attentional control in dynamic situations, and it is suggested that persistence of attentional settings will be most costly under stable conditions. © Experimental Psychology Society 2023.",attentional control; attentional inertia; eye movements; set switching; Top-down attentional set,Medicine,SAGE Publications Ltd,Article,Scopus

There is limited evidence that these recommendations are used by exercise instructors in the community to underpin strength training prescription in the older adult population. This study aimed to explore exercise instructors’ awareness and utilisation of the guidelines when prescribing strength training to older adults. Fifteen exercise instructors working with older adults in the UK participated in one online interview. A general inductive approach was conducted and thematic analysis allowed for major themes to be identified from the raw data. We found that most exercise instructors (n = 9), but not all (n = 6), were aware of the guidelines. Only one instructor (n = 1) had reportedly implemented the guidelines into their practice; other instructors reported that the guidelines were irrelevant. Instead, each of the instructors had their preferred sources of information that they relied on to underpin their exercise prescription, and each had their own interpretation of ‘evidence-based strength training.’ This individualised interpretation resulted in exceptionally varied prescription in the community and does not necessarily align with the progressive, evidence-based prescription known to build muscular strength. We suggest that (i) more detail on how to build muscular strength be embedded within the guidelines, (ii) a handbook on how to implement the guidelines be made available, (iii) theoretical and practical teaching materials and courses be updated, and/or (iv) a re-(education) of exercise instructors already in the field may be necessary to bring about a consistent, evidence-based strength prescription necessary for the best possible health and longevity outcomes for our ageing population. © 2023, The Author(s).",Ageing; Government; Policy; Recommendations; Resistance training,Medicine,BioMed Central Ltd,Article,Scopus

A crucial challenge for developing a MIS robot is the kinematic design of the remote center-of-motion (RCM) mechanism. In this paper, a class of spatial RCM mechanism is analyzed. They are obtained by generating virtual parallelograms. The main process is to construct a line that passes through a fixed point under the mechanical constraint. The axis of the surgical tool is then constrained to parallel with that line. Hence, due to the geometrical feature of the parallel lines, the axis of the surgical tool will always pass through a fixed point, i.e., the RCM point. Due to the specially designed structure, the fixed point does not need to be physically belonging to the mechanism. The geometrical analysis method is employed to obtain the closed-form solution of the forward kinematics of the proposed mechanisms. Due to the high load capacity of parallel mechanism, the robots based on the proposed RCM mechanisms have promising applications as an external positioner to be used in robotic single-port surgeries.  © The Author(s), 2022.

Holt E.,Student counsellors’ experiences of mindfulness as a component of their person-centred counselling training: An interpretative phenomenological analysis,Counselling and Psychotherapy Research,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125658525&doi=10.1002%2fcapr.12524&partnerID=40&md5=7cebe88a8d4721ba1f1bbc5d18be3679,"Aim: Mindfulness is increasingly integrated into counselling and psychotherapy practices, as well as being introduced to students in academic institutes with the aim of supporting them to balance the responsibilities of academic study, placements and other commitments alongside university life. Despite mindfulness routinely finding its way into counselling settings and being incorporated into counsellor training, there has yet to be any research conducted to explore the experience of student counsellors who have received mindfulness as a part of their undergraduate person-centred training. This study explored the reflections of counsellors who had attended a mindfulness module during the first year of a counselling degree. Design: Six students completing a university-based undergraduate degree in Counselling and Psychotherapy in the North-West of England, in the UK, participated in the research. The study consisted of two students from each of the three years of the programme. Participants individually attended a semi-structured interview to explore their experiences of mindfulness as a mandatory module of their training in person-centred counselling. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used to analyse the generated data. Findings: Four superordinate themes were generated: 1) becoming a counsellor, 2) person-centred mindfulness, 3) time, and 4) learning and development. Discussion: Experiential themes were explored including the process of professionalism, vulnerability, embodiment of person-centred theory and the core conditions and the conflict of approach. Conclusion: Recommendations are made for mindfulness to be included in counselling training programmes with a person-centred focus. Suggestions for further research include longitudinal studies to follow the development of trainees over time. © 2022 The Authors.

Acute performance, daily well-being and hormone responses to water immersion after resistance exercise in junior international and subelite male volleyball athletes. J Strength Cond Res 37(8): 1643-1653, 2023 - Athletes use postexercise hydrotherapy strategies to improve recovery and competition performance and to enhance adaptative responses to training. Using a randomized cross-over design, the acute effects of 3 postresistance exercise water immersion strategies on perceived recovery, neuromuscular performance, and hormone concentrations in junior international and subelite male volleyball athletes (n = 18) were investigated. After resistance exercise, subjects randomly completed either 15-minute passive control (CON), contrast water therapy (CWT), cold (CWI), or hot water immersion (HWI) interventions. A treatment effect occurred after HWI; reducing perceptions of fatigue (HWI > CWT: p = 0.05, g = 0.43); improved sleep quality, compared with CON (p < 0.001, g = 1.15), CWI (p = 0.017, g = 0.70), and CWT (p = 0.018, g = 0.51); as well as increasing testosterone concentration (HWI > CWT: p = 0.038, g = 0.24). There were trivial to small (p < 0.001-0.039, g = 0.02-0.34) improvements (treatment effect) in jump performance (i.e., squat jump and countermovement jump) after all water immersion strategies, as compared with CON, with high variability in the individual responses. There were no significant differences (interaction effect, p > 0.05) observed between the water immersion intervention strategies and CON in performance (p = 0.153-0.99), hormone (p = 0.207-0.938), nor perceptual (p = 0.368-0.955) measures. To optimize recovery and performance responses, e.g., during an in-season competition phase, postresistance exercise HWI may assist with providing small-to-large improvements for up to 38 hours in perceived recovery (i.e., increased sleep quality and reduced fatigue) and increases in circulating testosterone concentration. Practitioners should consider individual athlete neuromuscular performance responses when prescribing postexercise hydrotherapy. These findings apply to athletes who aim to improve their recovery status, where postresistance exercise HWI optimizes sleep quality and next-day perceptions of fatigue.

However, their effects on T cell proliferation and activation are not fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated effects of individual compounds including β-Boswellic acids (β-BA), 11-keto-β-Boswellic acid (β-KBA), 3-O-acetyl β-Boswellic acids (β-ABA), and 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β-Boswellic acid (β-AKBA) on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and their potential role in modulating immune responses. We showed that β-BA, KBA, and AKBA at a 0.025 µM concentration significantly reduced T cell proliferation without inducing cytotoxicity, however, ABA showed cytotoxic effects at this concentration. β-BA and KBA showed significantly reduced T cell proliferation at 0.05 µM concentration without cytotoxic effects. Interestingly, we found that AKBA at 0.025 µM concentration significantly reduced CD25 expression on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells without cytotoxic effects. Additionally, β-BA reduced CD25 expression on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at 0.05 µM concentration with no cytotoxicity. In this study, we determined the optimum concentration of each of these compounds that have the potential to reduce T cell activation without cytotoxic effects. Our findings show that both β-BA and AKBA have the ability to inhibit T cell proliferation and activation without inducing cytotoxicity. Further investigations are required to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these effects and the potential therapeutic benefits of these compounds in different autoimmune and inflammatory settings. © 2023 The Author(s)",AKBA; Boswellic acids; CD25; KBA; Proliferation; T cells; β-ABA; β-BA,Medicine,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

Access to appropriate footwear is important but recent challenges with the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in closure of retail stores for prolonged periods where parents/carers could not physically purchase footwear for their children and the footwear industry suffered disruption to their supply chain, and falls in retail sales. Simultaneously increased use of social media platforms for health information seeking throughout the pandemic have been documented. This likely would have included parents/carers seeking information online to support footwear purchases for their children. The primary aim of this work was to explore how searches for online fitting information for children changed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown periods. A secondary aim was to identify how searches were influenced by footwear style. Methods: We employed Google Trends to obtain search engine traffic related to footwear fitting information for children. We collected data spanning the three years pre, during and post the main national lockdown for three eight-week windows: (1) first eight weeks of the U.K. national lockdown; (2) the first eight weeks of the calendaryear; (3) the eight weeks leading up to children going back-to-school for the new academic year in the U.K. The search terms reflected parents/carers searching for footwear fit information relating to children and were grouped by style of footwear: children, infants, babies and toddlers as well as school shoes. Results: We identified increased searching for footwear fit information for children during the pandemic, which reduced following post pandemic in all except the searches which related to school shoes. We saw reductions in searching related to fit of school shoes as schools closed indefinitely and an increase in online searches with the pandemic. This was also maintained post-pandemic despite shops reopening, suggesting that some of these changes in information reflect new consumer behaviours which may continue. Conclusions: Increased searches for online resources regarding footwear fit highlights the importance of ensuring high quality accessible online information on footwear fit is available to support those buying footwear for their children. © 2023, The Author(s).",Children; COVID; Fit; Footwear; Health advice; Online purchase,Medicine,BioMed Central Ltd,Article,Scopus

The location of knee joint degeneration and long-term prognosis differs between knees who have had a medial or lateral meniscectomy. However, there is no evidence comparing knee loading following a medial or lateral meniscectomy during sporting tasks. This study compared knee loading during walking and running between individuals who either had a medial or lateral meniscectomy. Methods: Knee kinematic and kinetic data were collected during walking and running in individuals three to twelve months post-surgery. Participants were grouped according to the location of surgery (medial, n = 12, and lateral, n = 16). An independent t-test compared knee biomechanics between the groups and Hedge's g effects sizes were also conducted. Results: External knee adduction and knee flexion moments were similar between groups for walking and running with negligible to small effect sizes (effect size, 0.08–0.30). Kinematic (effect size, 0.03–0.22) and spatiotemporal (effect size, 0.02–0.59) outcomes were also similar between the groups. Conclusions: The lack of differences in surrogate knee loading variables between medial and lateral meniscectomy groups was unexpected. These findings suggest that combining groups in the short-term period following surgery is applicable. However, the data presented in this study cannot explain the differences in long-term prognosis between medial and lateral meniscectomies. © 2023 The Author(s)",Kinetics; Knee joint loading; Meniscal injury; Running,Medicine,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

Recent studies demonstrate no survival advantage for non-anatomical resection compared to lobectomy in patients with early-stage lung cancer. The objective of this study was to investigate whether in patients with T1 tumours, non-anatomical wedge resection is associated with equivalent survival to lobectomy. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent lung resection at the Lancashire Cardiac Centre between April 2005 and April 2018. Patients were subjected to multidisciplinary team discussion. The extent of resection was decided by the team based on British Thoracic Society guidelines. The primary outcome was overall survival. Propensity matching of patients with T1 tumours was also performed to determine whether differences in survival rates exist in a subset of these patients with balanced pre-operative characteristics. Results: There were 187 patients who underwent non-anatomical wedge resection and 431 patients who underwent lobectomy. Cox modelling demonstrated no survival difference between groups for the first 1.6 years then a risk of death 3-fold higher for wedge resection group after 1.6 years (HR 3.14, CI 1.98–4.79). Propensity matching yielded 152 pairs for which 5-year survival was 66.2% for the lobectomy group and 38.5% for the non-anatomical wedge group (SMD = 0.58, p = 0.003). Conclusions: Non-anatomical wedge resection was associated with significantly reduced 5-year survival compared to lobectomy in matched patients. Lobectomy should remain the standard of care for patients with early-stage lung cancer who are fit enough to undergo surgical resection. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Cancer; Lobectomy; Lung; Resection; Survival; Wedge,Medicine,BioMed Central Ltd,Article,Scopus

In response to this situation, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation rolled out nurse-led mental health units (MHUs) to every district. This study evaluates the barriers and facilitators to mental health service delivery in decentralised MHUs in Sierra Leone using key informant interviews and focus group discussions with 13 purposefully sampled clinical staff and senior management personnel. The interviews were audio-recorded, translated from Krio if necessary, transcribed, and analysed using manifest content analysis. The findings suggest that factors affecting nurse-led mental health service delivery include small workforce and high workload, culture and beliefs, risks, lack of safety measures and required resources, outdated policies, poor salaries, lack of funds for medication, distance, power, influence, and stigma. Factors that could facilitate nurse-led mental health services include: increasing motivation, increasing the workforce, knowledge sharing, mentorship, availability of medication, passion and modern psychiatry. The findings contribute towards understanding the challenges and opportunities faced by the recently established nurse-led decentralised mental health services across Sierra Leone, in order to address the large mental health treatment gap. We hope the findings will inform further policy and planning to improve the quality of decentralised mental healthcare. © 2023, The Author(s).",LMIC’s; Monitoring and evaluation; Motivation; Traditional healing,Medicine,Springer,Article,Scopus

This study aimed to (1) understand older women's experiences of UI, their self-management strategies and support needs; (2) explore health professionals' experiences of supporting women and providing relevant services and (3) combine their experiences contribute to development of a theory-based and evidence-based self-management package for UI. Design Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 older women with UI and 11 specialist health professionals. Data were analysed independently using the framework approach, then synthesised in a triangulation matrix to identify implications for content and delivery of the self-management package. Setting Community centres, community continence clinic and urogynaecology centre of a local teaching hospital in northern England. Participants Women aged 55 years and over who self-reported symptoms of UI and health professionals delivering UI services. Results Three overarching themes emerged. Older women see UI as a fact of life' but many struggle with it: women typically considered UI as part of ageing yet expressed annoyance, distress, embarrassment and had made significant lifestyle changes. Access to information and limited high-quality professional support: health professionals provided specialist UI care and information. Yet less than half of women accessed specialist services, those who had, highly valued these services. Trial and error' with different self-management strategies: women had tried or were using different strategies (continence pads, pelvic floor exercises, bladder management and training, fluid management and medication), with mixed success. Health professionals provided evidence-based, personalised support and motivation. Conclusions Findings informed the content of the self-management package that focused on providing facts, acknowledging challenges of living with/self-managing UI, sharing others' experiences, using motivational strategies and self-management tools.

As part of a randomised controlled trial, this study investigated participants' perceptions of wearing arthritis gloves. Method: Participants with RA and persistent hand pain (n = 206) were randomly assigned and prescribed either loose-fitting gloves (control) or arthritis gloves (intervention), for day and/or night wear (as per individual need). At 12-weeks, the trial follow-up questionnaire also included items about whether the gloves prescribed were: beneficial or not; if yes, the benefits experienced; any problems encountered; if they stopped wearing gloves day and/or night, and why. Results: The questionnaire response rate was 154/206 (75%). In both groups, 73% reported gloves were beneficial (p = 0.97). There were no differences in types of benefits reported. The most common were: warmth (59% control: 54% intervention; p = 0.53); and comfort (54%: 62%; p = 0.29). Fewer reported problems with glove wear in the control group (33%), compared to the intervention group (49%); p = 0.05. In both groups, the most common daytime problem was inability to wear gloves for wet or dirty activities; and at night, gloves being too hot. Similar numbers in the control and intervention groups stopped wearing gloves either day or night (23%: 31%; p = 0.26), primarily for these reasons. Discussion: Participants' perceptions about wearing arthritis or loose-fitting gloves were very similar. Wearing ordinary gloves could result in similar perceived benefits to arthritis gloves. © 2022 The Authors.

The three extant pitheciine genera, Pithecia, Cacajao and Chiropotes, are all endemic to the Amazon region. Because of the uncertainties about interspecific relationships, we reviewed the systematics and taxonomy of the genus Chiropotes. The phylogenetic analyses were performed based on Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference, while species delimitation analyses were carried out using multispecies coalescent methods. In addition, we estimated genetic distances, divergence time and the probable ancestral distribution of this genus. Our results support five species of Chiropotes that emerged during the Plio-Pleistocene. Biogeographic estimates suggest that the ancestor of the current Chiropotes species occupied the endemism areas from Rondônia and Tapajós. Later, subsequent radiation and founder effects associated with the formation of the Amazonian basins probably determined the speciation events within Chiropotes. © 2023 by the authors.",biogeography Chiropotes; cuxiu; phylogeny,Medicine,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Scopus

This is a key concern for environmental risk and human health. 63 top soil samples were collected at a distance of 10 m (Zone 1), 50 m (Zone 2), and 100 m (Zone 3) from near 21 mica mines with agriculture fields. The mean concentration of total and bio-available toxic elements (TEs - Cr, Ni, Pb, Cu, Zn, and Cd) was higher in zone 1 across three zones. The Positive matrix factorization model (PMF) and Pearson Correlation analysis were used to identify waste mica soils with TEs. Based on PMF results, Ni, Cr, Cd, and Pb were the most promising pollutants and carried higher environmental risks than the other TEs. Using the self-organizing map (SOM), zone 1 was identified as a high-potential source of TEs. Soil quality indexes for TEs risk zone 1 were found to be higher across three zones. Based on the health risk index (HI), children are more adversely affected than adults. Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) model and sensitivity analysis of total carcinogenic risk (TCR), children were more affected by Cr and Ni than adults through ingestion exposure pathways. Finally, a geostatistical tool was developed to predict the spatial distribution patterns of TEs contributed by mica mines. In a probabilistic assessment of all populations, non-carcinogenic risks appeared to be negligible. The fact that there is a TCR can't be ignored, and children are more likely to develop it than adults. Mica mines with TEs contamination were found to be the most significant anthropogenic contributor to health risks based on source-oriented risk assessment. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",GIS; Health risk assessment; MCS; PMF; SOM; TEs,Medicine,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Scopus

We report on the level of implementation and engagement with the SMART Work & Life (SWAL) programme (delivered with (SWAL plus desk) and without a height-adjustable desk (SWAL)) and explore the effects of different levels of this on change in daily sitting time in comparison to the control group. Methods: The extent of intervention delivery by workplace champions and the extent of engagement by champions and participants (staff) with each intervention activity was assessed by training attendance logs, workplace champion withdrawal dates, intervention activities logs and questionnaires. These data were used to assess whether a cluster met defined criteria for low, medium, or high implementation and engagement or none of these. Mixed effects linear regression analyses tested whether change in sitting time varied by: (i) the number of intervention activities implemented and engaged with, and (ii) the percentage of implementation and engagement with all intervention strategies. Results: Workplace champions were recruited for all clusters, with 51/52 (98%) attending training. Overall, 12/27 (44.4%) SWAL and 9/25 (36.0%) SWAL plus desk clusters implemented all main intervention strategies. Across remaining clusters, the level of intervention implementation varied. Those in the SWAL (n = 8 (29.6%) clusters, 80 (32.1%) participants) and SWAL plus desk (n = 5 (20.0%) clusters, 41 (17.1%) participants) intervention groups who implemented and engaged with the most intervention strategies and had the highest percentage of cluster implementation and engagement with all intervention strategies sat for 30.9 (95% CI -53.9 to -7.9, p = 0.01) and 75.6 (95% CI -103.6 to -47.7, p < 0.001) fewer minutes/day respectively compared to the control group at 12 month follow up. These differences were larger than the complete case analysis. The differences in sitting time observed for the medium and low levels were similar to the complete case analysis. Conclusions: Most intervention strategies were delivered to some extent across the clusters although there was large variation. Superior effects for sitting reduction were seen for those intervention groups who implemented and engaged with the most intervention components and had the highest level of cluster implementation and engagement.

Research on the effects of different treatment approaches is needed for children and adolescents with (symptoms of complex) PTSD resulting from repeated sexual and/or physical abuse during childhood. Objective: This paper describes the rationale, study design, and methods of the MARS-study, a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) that aims to compare the results of phase-based treatment with those of immediate trauma-focused treatment and determine whether immediate trauma-focused treatment is not worse than phase-based treatment in reducing PTSD symptoms. Methods: Participants are individuals between 12 and 18 years who meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD due to repeated sexual abuse, physical abuse, or domestic violence during childhood. Participants will be blindly allocated to either the phase-based or immediate trauma-focused treatment condition. In the phase-based treatment condition, participants receive 12 sessions of the Dutch version of Skill Training in Affective and Interpersonal Regulation (STAIR-A), followed by 12 sessions of EMDR therapy. In the immediate trauma-focused condition, the participants receive 12 sessions of EMDR therapy. The two groups are compared for several outcome variables before treatment, mid-treatment (only in the phase-based treatment condition), after 12 trauma-focused treatment sessions (post-treatment), and six months post-treatment (follow-up). The main parameter is the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for Children and Adolescents, CAPS-CA). The secondary outcome variables are the severity of complex PTSD symptoms (Interpersonal Problems as measured by the Experiences in Close Relationship-Revised, ECR-RC; Emotion Regulation as measured by the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, DERS; Self Esteem as measured by the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, RSES), changes in anxiety and mood symptoms (Revised Anxiety and Depression Scale; RCADS), changes in posttraumatic cognitions (Child Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory, CPTCI), changes in general psychopathology symptoms (Child Behavior Checklist, CBCL), and Quality of Life (Youth Outcome Questionnaire, Y-OQ-30). Furthermore, parental stress (Opvoedingsvragenlijst, OBVL) and patient-therapist relationship (Feedback Informed Treatment, FIT) will be measured, whereas PTSD symptoms will be monitored in each session during both treatment conditions (Children’s Revised Impact of Event Scale, CRIES-13). Discussion: Treating (symptoms of complex) PTSD in children and adolescents with a history of repeated sexual and/or physical abuse during childhood is of great importance. However, there is a lack of consensus among trauma experts regarding the optimal treatment approach. The results of the current study may have important implications for selecting effective treatment options for clinicians working with children and adolescents who experience the effects of exposure to multiple interpersonal traumatic events during childhood.

Ten strength-power athletes with at least 6 months of training experience performing the power snatch participated in this study, which consisted of 3 experimental protocols performed in a randomized repeated-measures design. The 3 protocols involved performing the power snatch for 3 sets of 5 repetitions at an average load of 75% 1 repetition maximum with a traditional (TRAD), cluster (CLU), or ascending cluster (A-CLU) protocol, where the training load was progressively increased across the set. Kinematic variables and internal loads (heart rate, blood lactate, and rate of perceived exertion) were measured during each protocol. The athletes maintained peak velocity (PV) and peak power (PP) and exhibited lower internal loads during CLU sets when compared with TRAD sets, whereas they displayed significant decreases in PV during TRAD sets. However, there were no statistically significant differences in PV and PP responses between the TRAD and CLU protocol. The athletes exhibited a significant decrease in PV, whereas PP was increased across each set in the A-CLU protocol, with lower internal loads observed compared with the TRAD protocol. Overall, the training loads used in this study do not appear to maximize the benefits of using CLU set during 3 sets of power snatches performed for 5 repetitions. In addition, A-CLU sets may potentially be useful as a means of maximizing the power output of the athlete. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

Fifteen resistance-trained male subjects (age = 26.4 ± 2.5 years; height = 1.75 ± 0.09 m; body mass = 82.6 ± 13.4 kg) participated in this study. All subjects completed 2 familiarization and 2 experimental sessions using both the Smith machine and free-weight SJs each separated by 48 hours. During the experimental trials, progressively loaded SJs were performed in a quasi-randomized block order with loads between 21 kg and 100% of the subject's body mass. Agreement between exercise mode was determined with a weighted least products regression analysis. No fixed or proportional bias was noted between exercise modes when using peak velocity (PV) and mean velocity (MV) to create an FV profile. There was no fixed and proportional bias present for the LV profile when the profile was created with PV. When the LV profile was calculated from MV, fixed and proportional bias were present, indicating that MVs were significantly different between exercise modes. In addition, the free-weight FV and LV profiles exhibited poor to good relative and good to poor absolute reliability. Furthermore, when created using the Smith machine, both profiles exhibited poor to moderate relative and absolute reliability. Based on these data, caution should be used when interpreting LV and FV profiles created with these 2 methods. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

Hunters rely on their knowledge of species ecology and behavior to develop and employ hunting techniques and increase their chances of success. The comparison of the hunting practices of different human societies can shed light on the sustainability of hunting and the impact it has on species’ populations. In this study, we examine and compare the techniques, modalities, and baits used by urban and rural hunters in Rondônia, a state in southwestern Amazonia, Brazil. We expected that rural hunters would use these elements and have greater knowledge when compared to urban hunters. We also expect that the use of specific hunting techniques and modalities will have greater selectivity and specificity of capture for rural hunters and that this knowledge will differ between groups. Methods: We conducted 106 semi-structured interviews with rural and urban hunters from October 2018 to February 2020. We analyzed the data using PERMANOVA and Network analyses to compare and contrast the hunting practices of each group. Results: We recorded four main hunting techniques divided into ten modalities with three techniques and seven modalities being the preferred choices among hunters. Waiting for at a Fruit Tree was cited as the primary technique employed by hunters living in urban and rural areas indicated. While the techniques and modalities were similar among hunters, the composition of species targeted and baits used differed between groups. Our network approach showed that modularity in urban areas was numerically lower than in rural areas. All species had one to more techniques associated with their capture. Conclusions: Hunters living in urban and rural environments showed high similarity in their practices, probably due to sharing similar environments to hunt containing similar species, as well as targeting preferably the same species. © 2023, The Author(s).",Amazon; Harvest; Hunting strategies; Lures; Wildlife use,Medicine,BioMed Central Ltd,Article,Scopus

Staff within organisations volunteered to be trained to facilitate delivery of the SWAL intervention and act as workplace champions. This paper presents the experiences of these champions on the training and intervention delivery, and from participants on their intervention participation. Methods: Quantitative and qualitative feedback from workplace champions on their training session was collected. Participants provided quantitative feedback via questionnaires at 3 and 12 month follow-up on the intervention strategies (education, group catch ups, sitting less challenges, self-monitoring and prompts, and the height-adjustable desk [SWAL plus desk group only]). Interviews and focus groups were also conducted at 12 month follow-up with workplace champions and participants respectively to gather more detailed feedback. Transcripts were uploaded to NVivo and the constant comparative approach informed the analysis of the interviews and focus groups. Results: Workplace champions rated the training highly with mean scores ranging from 5.3/6 to 5.7/6 for the eight parts. Most participants felt the education increased their awareness of the health consequences of high levels of sitting (SWAL: 90.7%; SWAL plus desk: 88.2%) and motivated them to change their sitting time (SWAL: 77.5%; SWAL plus desk: 85.77%). A high percentage of participants (70%) reported finding the group catch up session helpful and worthwhile. However, focus groups highlighted mixed responses to the group catch-up sessions, sitting less challenges and self-monitoring intervention components. Participants in the SWAL plus desk group felt that having a height-adjustable desk was key in changing their behaviour, with intrinsic as well as time based factors reported as key influences on the height-adjustable desk usage. In both intervention groups, participants reported a range of benefits from the intervention including more energy, less fatigue, an increase in focus, alertness, productivity and concentration as well as less musculoskeletal problems (SWAL plus desk group only). Work-related, interpersonal, personal attributes, physical office environment and physical barriers were identified as barriers when trying to sit less and move more. Conclusions: Workplace champion and participant feedback on the intervention was largely positive but it is clear that different behaviour change strategies worked for different people indicating that a ‘one size fits all’ approach may not be appropriate for this type of intervention. The SWAL intervention could be tested in a broader range of organisations following a few minor adaptations based on the champion and participant feedback.

However, male CSA is significantly underreported, with men being reluctant to disclose due to vulnerability, stigmatisation, homophobic responses and fearing a loss of masculinity. A lack of research and service provision targeted towards men suggests male survivors of CSA are marginalised. This qualitative study, using a narrative approach, focussed on four adult male survivors of CSA. The aim of the study was to explore their experiences of engaging in counselling and support services for CSA from nonstatutory and voluntary organisations. Face-to-face narrative interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Analysis was undertaken using a two-phase approach; first, each narrative was analysed as a whole; second, an across-transcripts analysis was carried out to identify shared themes and divergences that emerged from the individual stories. In this paper, findings from the second phase of the analysis are presented. Three themes regarding male survivors' experiences of specialist counselling services were identified: “Trust Me, I'm a Doctor,” “Trust me, I'm a Counsellor” and “Counsellor or Mother?” This is the first academic study focussing specifically on men's experience of support for CSA in the UK from a service user perspective. Making an original contribution to the knowledge base regarding counselling experiences and the effectiveness of therapy for male CSA survivors, it will help to inform professional counselling services which are likely to come into contact with male survivors of CSA. © 2022 The Authors.

Dynamic and isometric force-time curve characteristics influencing change of direction performance of state-level netball players. J Strength Cond Res 37(12): 2397-2404, 2023 - Although multiple lower-body strength capacities are required to change direction rapidly, there is limited knowledge about the relative importance of these factors. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between dynamic and isometric lower-body strength capacities and change of direction (COD) time in state-league netball players. Seventeen female athletes completed maximal isometric midthigh pull (IMTP), countermovement jump (CMJ), and modified 5-0-5 COD tests. Pearson's product moment correlations were used to determine the relationship between COD time and several IMTP and CMJ force-time curve characteristics. To assess the level of contribution of each force-time curve characteristic to COD time, multivariate-linear stepwise regression analyses were performed. A significant moderate correlation was noted between net relative peak force (PF) during the IMTP and COD time (r = 0.488, p = 0.047), accounting for 23.8% of the variance in COD time. Moreover, concentric relative impulse during the CMJ was strongly correlated with COD time (r = 0.718; p = 0.001), explaining 81.9% of the variance in COD time when combined with net relative braking PF in a stepwise regression. Based on these findings, female netball players who display higher concentric and isometric strength, as well as the ability to express higher impulses during the concentric phase of the CMJ, are likely to perform CODs faster. This may occur because COD requires the generation of greater propulsive forces, as well as reduced braking and contact times, along with greater isometric strength enabling effective repositioning of center of mass during COD tasks. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

However, the best surgical option for short bowel syndrome (SBS) remains unknown. This paper presents our experience using combined procedures as primary treatment. Methods: We collected data on SBS patients who underwent surgery from 2008 to 2021 in two tertiary European Centres. Combined procedures were defined as more than one technique used on the same patient. Charts were reviewed for demographics, type of procedures, complications, and outcomes. Data are presented as median and IQR. Wilcoxon signed rank was used for all paired analyses. Results: Twenty-one children (12 females) underwent combined procedures. Preoperative median small bowel length was 20 cm (IQR: 15–35 cm); after lengthening, it was 35.5 cm (IQR: 30.75–50.50 cm) (P < 0.001). Combined procedures were simultaneous in 15 patients and sequential in 6. At a median of 9.2 years (IQR: 7.55–9.78 years) follow-up, complications were three bowel obstructions after strictures of anastomosis and two wound infections. Two patients achieved enteral autonomy, and others followed a weaning home parenteral nutrition regimen with a median of 4 nights off (IQR: 3–4 nights) starting with a median of 7 nights (IQR: 7–7 nights). Conclusions: Combined AGIR techniques are practical and safe in SBS treatment when tailored to meet patients' needs, combining lengthening, tailoring, and reducing transit time procedures. Therefore, combined AGIR may be considered a resource in intestinal rehabilitation units' armamentarium. © 2022 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.",autologous gastrointestinal procedures; intestinal failure; intestinal surgery; pediatric short bowel syndrome; short bowel syndrome,Medicine,John Wiley and Sons Inc,Article,Scopus

Fifteen resistance-trained men performed JS and HHP repetitions with 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% of their 1RM hang power clean, and mean (MBV) and peak barbell velocity (PBV) were determined by each velocity measurement device. Least-products regression and Bland–Altman plots were used to examine instances of proportional, fixed, and systematic bias between the TENDO and PUSH compared to the GA. Hedge’s g effect sizes were also calculated to determine any meaningful differences between devices. The GA and TENDO displayed excellent reliability and acceptable variability during the JS and HHP while the PUSH showed instances of poor–moderate reliability and unacceptable variability at various loads. While the TENDO and PUSH showed instances of various bias, the TENDO device demonstrated greater validity when compared to the GA. Trivial–small differences were shown between the GA and TENDO during the JS and HHP exercises while trivial–moderate differences existed between GA and PUSH during the JS. However, despite trivial–small effects between the GA and PUSH devices at 20 and 40% 1RM during the HHP, practically meaningful differences existed at 60, 80, and 100%, indicating that the PUSH velocity outputs were not accurate. The TENDO appears to be more reliable and valid than the PUSH when measuring MBV and PBV during the JS and HHP. © 2023 by the authors.",load–velocity profile; power clean; velocity-based training; weightlifting,Medicine,MDPI,Article,Scopus

Additionally, the influence of weightlifting expertise (beginner, advanced and elite) on EMG activity was analyzed. Twenty-seven weightlifters (beginner: n = 11, age: 23.9 ± 3.2 years, bodyweight: 75.7 ± 10.5 kg; advanced: n = 10, age: 24.8 ± 4.5 years, bodyweight: 69.4 ± 13.9 kg; elite: n = 6, age: 25.5 ± 5.2 years, bodyweight: 75.5 ± 12.5 kg) participated in this study. Participants performed two repetitions of HPC, HPS, HCP, and HSP at 50%, 70%, and 90% 1RM, respectively. The EMG activity of vastus lateralis (VL), gluteus maximus (GM), erector spinae (ES), rectus abdominis (RA) and trapezius (TZ) was recorded and normalized to the maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of each muscle. There were significant differences in RA and ES EMG activity at 70% and 90% 1RM during HPC compared to HCP in the beginner group (p < 0.05, Hedges g = 0.50-1.06). Significant greater ES activity was observed in the beginner, advanced, and elite groups (p < 0.05, g = 0.27-0.98) during the HPS when compared to the HSP at 50-90% 1RM. TZ muscle activity was significantly greater at 50% and 70% 1RM in the HCP compared to the HPC in the elite group (p < 0.05, g = 0.61-1.08), while the beginner group reached significance only at 50% 1RM favoring HPC (p < 0.05, g = 0.38). Moreover, the EMG activity of the TZ during the HSP and HPS was significantly different only at 50% 1RM in the elite group and favored HSP (p < 0.05, g = 0.27). No differences were observed between the levels of weightlifting expertise. Based upon the results of this study, the overall pattern of EMG activity of the predominant muscles involved in HPC/HPS and the corresponding weightlifting pulling derivatives, apart from the stabilizing muscle (RA and ES), is similar at higher intensities (>70% 1RM) and expertise does not influence muscle activity. © Journal of Sports Science and Medicine.",Electromyography; expertise; motor learning; muscle excitation; muscle recruitment; weightlifting,Medicine,,Article,Scopus

European guidelines recommend favoring multichamber bag PN (MCB PN), when possible, for quality purposes and ease of use. The prescribers may adjust the MCB PN through supplementations to better fulfill patient needs. The objective of this study is to investigate the use and supplementations of MCB PN. Methods: This observational, single-center, retrospective study was conducted in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). We collected prescriptions of MCB PNs and their supplementations added directly into PN bags. A descriptive analysis and a comparison of electrolyte supplementations with the manufacturer's recommendations were undertaken. Results: One hundred thirty-five children (median age 39.2 months [7.0–118.8]) were included, 1449 MCB PNs were administered, and 1652 supplementations were carried out in 736 PN bags. Thirty-two percent of supplementations were vitamins, 32.2% were trace elements, and 35.8% were electrolytes. Around 10% of electrolyte supplementations in PN bags were outside the manufacturer's recommendations. These nonconformities primarily concerned phosphate. Conclusion: This study showed the real-world clinical use of MCB PN in the PICU. Proper attention should be paid to septic risks and physicochemical risks to ensure efficient practice and safety of MCB PN use. © 2022 The Authors.

Discerning patterns of change in wild mammal populations can therefore prove challenging. We used high-throughput community sequencing methods to characterise the microbiome of wild field voles (Microtus agrestis) from faecal samples collected across 12 live-trapping field sessions, and then at cull. Changes in α- and β-diversity were modelled over three timescales. Short-term differences (following 1–2 days captivity) were analysed between capture and cull, to ascertain the degree to which the microbiome can change following a rapid change in environment. Medium-term changes were measured between successive trapping sessions (12–16 days apart), and long-term changes between the first and final capture of an individual (from 24 to 129 days). The short period between capture and cull was characterised by a marked loss of species richness, while over medium and long-term in the field, richness slightly increased. Changes across both short and long timescales indicated shifts from a Firmicutes-dominant to a Bacteroidetes-dominant microbiome. Dramatic changes following captivity indicate that changes in microbiome diversity can be rapid, following a change of environment (food sources, temperature, lighting etc.). Medium- and long-term patterns of change indicate an accrual of gut bacteria associated with ageing, with these new bacteria being predominately represented by Bacteroidetes. While the patterns of change observed are unlikely to be universal to wild mammal populations, the potential for analogous shifts across timescales should be considered whenever studying wild animal microbiomes. This is especially true if studies involve animal captivity, as there are potential ramifications both for animal health, and the validity of the data itself as a reflection of a ‘natural’ state of an animal. © 2023, The Author(s).",Aging; Alpha Diversity; Beta Diversity; Captivity; Microbiome; Wild Populations,Medicine,BioMed Central Ltd,Article,Scopus

Lifting of walking frames when crossing door thresholds or when turning has shown to reduce stability, and certain design features drive the need to lift (e.g. small, non-swivelling wheels at the front). To overcome shortfalls in design and provide better stability, biomechanists and industrial engineers engaged in a Knowledge Transfer Partnership to develop a novel walking frame that reduces the need for lifting during everyday tasks. This paper presents the results for the final prototype regarding stability, safety and other aspects of usability. Methods: Four studies were conducted that explored the prototype in relation to the current standard frame: a detailed gait lab study of 9 healthy older adults performing repeated trials for a range of everyday tasks provided mechanical measures of stability, a real-world study that involved 9 users of walking frames provided measures of body weight transfer and lifting events, two interview studies (5 healthcare professionals and 7 users of walking frames) elicited stakeholder perceptions regarding stability, safety and usability. Results: Analysis of healthy older adults using a standard walking frame and the prototype frame demonstrated that the prototype increases stability during performance of complex everyday tasks (p < 0.05). Similarly, gait assessments of walking frame users in their home environment showed that the prototype facilitated safer usage patterns and provided greater and more continuous body weight support. Interviews with healthcare professionals and users showed that the prototype was perceived to be safe and effective and hence more usable. Conclusions: The outcomes of the separate studies all support the same conclusion: the prototype is an improvement on the status quo, the typical front-wheeled Zimmer frame for indoor use which has not changed in design for decades. The significance of this work lies in the success of the Knowledge Transfer Partnership and in biomechanics-informed design leading to improvements, which in future may be applied to other walking aids, to benefit walking aid users by promoting safer, more stable use of their aid. © 2023, The Author(s).",Design; Stability; Usability; Walking frame,Medicine,BioMed Central Ltd,Article,Scopus

Despite 40% prevalence in the community, little is known about the prevalence/incidence of UI in older women during hospital admission. UI during hospital admissions, within this group, has also been under-researched in terms of its relationship to specific clinical conditions and mortality rates. Given that UI has serious implications for both patient care and women’s general health and well-being on discharge, this protocol describes a planned research project which aims to determine mortality, morbidity, prevalence and incidence of UI in older women (≥55 years) during hospital admission to inform nursing practice. Additionally, it aims to explore the experience of nurses who deliver women’s care. Methods and analysis This is an explanatory mixed-methods study consisting of two phases: (1) retrospecitive analysis of electronic patient care records (EPCR) to determine prevalence/incidence of UI, clinical conditions most likely associated with UI and any associations between UI and death, (2) nurse interviews to explore views, knowledge and perceptions of performing the nursing assessment and providing care for older women (≥55 years) with UI during admission. EPCR will be gained from a National Health Service (NHS) teaching hospital. Nurse interviews will be conducted with nurses from an alternative but similar-sized NHS hospital. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is provided by the University of Salford Ethics Committee and regulatory approval by the NHS Health Research Authority (Integrated Research Application System project ID: 303118). Local NHS trust approval to access electronic care records for the purposes of analysis of anonymised data has been provided by one of the two collaborating NHS hospitals. Findings will be disseminated through open-access geriatric or urogynaecology journals and presented to relevant stakeholders at local, national and international meetings including scientific meetings such as the UK Continence Society and International Continence Society. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.",,Medicine,BMJ Publishing Group,Article,Scopus

For many wild mammals, the relationship between the structure of the GIT and diet is still poorly understood, for example, the GIT for frugivorous primates is usually classified as unspecialized and homogeneous. Here, we compare the GIT structure of 13 primate species from the three families of extant platyrrhines (Atelidae, Pitheciidae, and Cebidae) in Amazonia, and discuss possible evolutionary adaptations to different diets and trophic niches. Methods: We measured the length of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, cecum, colon, and rectum of the digestive tracts of 289 primate specimens. We determined the allometric relationships of the different tubular organs with the total length of the GIT as a proxy of specimen body size. Allometric parameters were used to establish the quotients of differentiation of every organ for each primate specimen. Results: There was a high differentiation in structure of the digestive organs among genera. Alouatta specimens clearly separated from the other genera based on dissimilarities in gastric, colonic, and rectal quotients, likely linked to the fermentation of plant contents. In contrast, all cebines (Sapajus, Cebus, and Saimiri) and Cacajao species had similar small intestine quotients, which is expected due to their high rates of animal matter consumed. Conclusions: We show that diverse adaptations in digestive structure exist among frugivorous primates, which in turn reflect different dietary patterns within this group that may enable the geographic coexistence of different primate species. © 2023 The Authors.

However, the high dimensionality of microarray datasets and small sample sizes pose challenges. Gene selection techniques have emerged as a promising solution to this challenge, potentially revolutionizing AD diagnosis. The study aims to investigate deep learning techniques, specifically neural networks, in predicting Alzheimer’s disease using microarray gene expression data. The goal is to develop a reliable predictive model for early detection and diagnosis, potentially improving patient care and intervention strategies. This study employed gene selection techniques, including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to pinpoint pertinent genes within microarray datasets. Leveraging deep learning principles, we harnessed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as our classifier for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prediction. Our approach involved the utilization of a seven-layer CNN with diverse configurations to process the dataset. Empirical outcomes on the AD dataset underscored the effectiveness of the PCA–CNN model, yielding an accuracy of 96.60% and a loss of 0.3503. Likewise, the SVD–CNN model showcased remarkable accuracy, attaining 97.08% and a loss of 0.2466. These results accentuate the potential of our method for gene dimension reduction and classification accuracy enhancement by selecting a subset of pertinent genes. Integrating gene selection methodologies with deep learning architectures presents a promising framework for elevating AD prediction and promoting precision medicine in neurodegenerative disorders. Ongoing research endeavors aim to generalize this approach for diverse applications, explore alternative gene selection techniques, and investigate a variety of deep learning architectures. © 2023 by the authors.",Alzheimer’s; convolutional neural networks (CNNs); deep learning; gene expression; microarray technique,Medicine,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Scopus

Methods: The three scales were forward translated and reviewed by an expert panel prior to cognitive debriefing interviews. Participants completed a postal questionnaire. Construct validity was assessed using Rasch analysis. Concurrent validity included testing between the three scales and work (e.g., Workplace Activity Limitations Scale [WALS]) and condition-specific health scales. Two weeks later, participants were mailed a second questionnaire to measure test-retest reliability. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 831 employed participants: 68% women, 53.5 (SD 8.9) years of age, with condition duration 7.7 (SD 8.0) years. The LTCJSS, LTCWSS and WHPLPS Parts 1 and 2 satisfied Rasch model requirements, but Part 3 did not. A Rasch transformation scale and Reference Metric equating scales with the WALS were created. Concurrent validity was generally good (rs = 0.41–0.85) for the three scales, except the WHPLPS Part 3. Internal consistency (Person Separation Index values) was consistent with group use in all conditions, and individual use except for the LTCWSS and WHPLSP Parts 1 and 2 in FM. Test-retest reliability was excellent, with intraclass coefficients (2,1) of 0.80–0.96 for the three scales in the four conditions.

Aiming to support the emotional and social wellbeing of caregivers, such as parents and teachers of children with ASD, a dance movement psychotherapy (DMP) intervention protocol was developed and implemented in a feasibility and process evaluation project. This article describes the development, and discusses the fidelity assessment, of the DMP intervention protocol. The fidelity assessment was conducted by calculating inter-rater reliability between three raters (therapist, researcher and external expert) on a 5-point Likert questionnaire through retrospective video analysis of the sessions. The results showed good agreement among the raters with a maximum mean difference of 0.57. High (75 % and above) adherence to the protocol was noted for 11 out of 12 criteria. The article critically evaluates the strengths and challenges of conducting a fidelity assessment of an intervention protocol. The overall structure and components of all the sessions of the protocol are illustrated in line with the template for intervention description and replication (TIDieR) checklist and guidelines to offer growing opportunities for replicable DMP intervention-based studies. © 2023",Autism spectrum disorders; Caregivers; Dance movement psychotherapy; Protocol development; Wellbeing,Medicine,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Scopus

Data from the first wave of the COVID19 pandemic demonstrated that these changes in infection prevention and control protocols were associated with an increase in healthcare associated bloodstream infections. We therefore explored the use of a protocol using short-sleeved gowns with hand and arm hygiene to reduce this risk. Methods: ICU staff were trained in wearing short-sleeved gowns and using a specific hand and arm washing technique between patients (experimental protocol). They then underwent simulation training, performing COVID-19 intubation and proning tasks using either experimental protocol or the standard (long-sleeved) control protocol. Fluorescent powder was used to simulate microbial contamination, detected using photographs under ultraviolet light. Teams were randomised to use control or experimental PPE first. During the simulation, staff were questioned on their feelings about personal safety, comfort and patient safety. Results: Sixty-eight staff and 17 proning volunteers were studied. Experimental PPE completely prevented staff contamination during COVID-19 intubation, whereas this occurred in 30/67 staff wearing control PPE (p =.003, McNemar). Proning volunteers were contaminated by staff in 15/17 control sessions and in 1/17 with experimental PPE (p =.023 McNemar). Staff comfort was superior with experimental PPE (p<.001, Wilcoxon). Their personal safety perception was initially higher with control PPE, but changed towards neutrality during sessions (p <.001 start, 0.068 end). Their impressions of patient safety were initially similar (p =.87), but finished strongly in favour of experimental PPE (p <.001). Conclusions: Short-sleeved gowns with hand and forearm cleansing appear superior to sessional long-sleeved gowns in preventing cross-contamination between staff and patients. © The Intensive Care Society 2022.",COVID19; infection control; intensive care; personal protective equipment; simulation,,SAGE Publications Inc.,Article,Scopus

Such a mask, however, identifies foot regions based on typical foot proportions and pressure gradients. Alternatively, the use of a customised mask retaining infants’ feet proportions has not been explored. Research question: Does a customised mask scaled on infants’ feet improve processing of pressure data collected during walking development compared with a standard mask? Methods: Thirteen infants walked across an EMED xl platform. Steps were grouped applying eight foot-regions standard and customised masks. To evaluate masks’ performance, peak pressure (PP) and contact area (CA) were extracted from each region, and mask. Intra-individual coefficients of variation were then calculated for each variable, and compared between masks using a Mann-Whitney U test (p < 0.05). Unsuccessful masks application was reported, expressed as percentage of data loss. Results: For CA variation, significant differences were found in all the regions but the lateral toes in new (Z = −0.184, p = 0.8540) and confident walking (Z = −1.562, p = 0.118). For PP variation, a significant difference was found in confident walking within the lateral midfoot (Z = −2.598, p = 0.009). With the standard mask, 22–27 % of data was lost in new and confident walking respectively, compared to 1.6–0 % with the customised. As a result, the customised mask characterised the more variable steps, demonstrating higher variation compared to the standard mask. Significance: Identifying foot regions using a mask based on infants’ feet proportions yielded an improved performance compared to the standard mask. With the customised mask, we retained almost all the steps and characterised the variability of the data, thereby providing an appropriate approach for infants’ pressure data processing. Application of the customised mask could therefore be beneficial in future studies analysing highly variable data sets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Infancy; Masking analysis; Plantar pressure; Regions of interest; Walking,,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

We undertook an online national survey of UK kidney centres to understand the nature, range, and degree of variation in these changes and to explore factors contributing to differing practice. Methods: The survey was designed by a multidisciplinary team of kidney professionals, service users and researchers. It enquired about centre services and staffing, including psychosocial provision, and changes to these in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Links to the survey were sent to all 68 UK kidney centres and remained active from December 2021 to April 2022, and a revised version to nurses in late 2022 for additional data. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively. Content analysis on free-text responses identified common themes. Results: Analysable responses were received from 41 out of the 68 UK centres (60%), with partial data from an additional 7 (11%). Adaptations were system-wide and affected all aspects of service provision. Some changes were almost universal such as virtual consultations for outpatient appointments, with significant variation in others. Outpatient activity varied from fully maintained to suspended. Many centres reduced peritoneal dialysis access provision but in some this was increased. Centres considered that changes to transplant surgical services and for patients with advanced CKD approaching end-stage kidney disease had the greatest impact on patients. Few centres implemented adjustments aimed at vulnerable and underrepresented groups, including the frail elderly, people with language and communication needs, and those with mental health needs. Communication issues were attributed to rapid evolution of the pandemic, changing planning guidance and lack of resources. Staffing shortages, involving all staff groups particularly nurses, mainly due to COVID-19 infection and redeployment, were compounded by deficiencies in staffing establishments and high vacancy levels. Centres cited three main lessons influencing future service delivery, the need for service redesign, improvements in communication, and better support for staff. Conclusion: Kidney centre responses to the pandemic involved adaptations across the whole service. Though some changes were almost universal, there was wide variation in other areas. Exploring the role of centre characteristics may help planning for potential future severe service disruptions. © 2023, The Author(s).",Chronic kidney disease; Coronavirus; Kidney care; Service provision,,BioMed Central Ltd,Article,Scopus

Methods: Forty-six home tour interviews led by people living with dementia were conducted in England and Scotland to better understand the connectivity between home and neighbourhood for people living with dementia. These interviews used a range of participatory and creative approaches including video, photographic images and in situ interviews. Data were analysed via reflexive thematic analysis. Results: Three themes were identified in data analysis. 1. Connected home and neighbourhood, where participants revealed the dynamic relationship between home and neighbourhood; 2. Practices of home, where participants discussed the everyday nature of their homes and routines; and 3. Displaying home and family, which reflected participant's biographical homes in the context of living with dementia. Discussion: The findings show that home holds multiple meanings for people living with dementia. For example, home is understood as a part of the neighbourhood and an extension of the home space into gardens and backyards, thus extending existing discourses that solely focus on the inside of people's homes. For people living with dementia, homes are also sites of negotiation and renegotiation where new meanings are created to reflect the changing nature and context of the home. There is not one fixed solution to these issues. Support and understanding for people living with dementia will need to evolve to adapt to the shifting dynamics and multiple meanings of home. © 2023 The Authors.

National Strength and Conditioning Association position statement on weightlifting for sports performance. J Strength Cond Res 37(6): 1163-1190, 2023 - The origins of weightlifting and feats of strength span back to ancient Egypt, China, and Greece, with the introduction of weightlifting into the Olympic Games in 1896. However, it was not until the 1950s that training based on weightlifting was adopted by strength coaches working with team sports and athletics, with weightlifting research in peer-reviewed journals becoming prominent since the 1970s. Over the past few decades, researchers have focused on the use of weightlifting-based training to enhance performance in nonweightlifters because of the biomechanical similarities (e.g., rapid forceful extension of the hips, knees, and ankles) associated with the second pull phase of the clean and snatch, the drive/thrust phase of the jerk and athletic tasks such as jumping and sprinting. The highest force, rate of force development, and power outputs have been reported during such movements, highlighting the potential for such tasks to enhance these key physical qualities in athletes. In addition, the ability to manipulate barbell load across the extensive range of weightlifting exercises and their derivatives permits the strength and conditioning coach the opportunity to emphasize the development of strength-speed and speed-strength, as required for the individual athlete. As such, the results of numerous longitudinal studies and subsequent meta-analyses demonstrate the inclusion of weightlifting exercises into strength and conditioning programs results in greater improvements in force-production characteristics and performance in athletic tasks than general resistance training or plyometric training alone. However, it is essential that such exercises are appropriately programmed adopting a sequential approach across training blocks (including exercise variation, loads, and volumes) to ensure the desired adaptations, whereas strength and conditioning coaches emphasize appropriate technique and skill development of athletes performing such exercises. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

A second-order polynomial regression was conducted with 95% confidence, and predictive intervals were calculated. The average of the newly contested body mass was then used as the intercept. Predictions were compared against current performances of the new weight categories up to the 2020 Olympics. Results revealed that the models for all competition types varied in their predictive ability for each performance zone, across each new weight category. On average, predicted Ptot displayed a difference from actual Ptot of 3.65 ± 2.51% (12.46 ± 9.16 kg), 0.78 ± 3.29% (2.26 ± 10.08 kg), and -1.13 ± 3.46% (-4.32 ± 11.10 kg) for the Olympics, and World and European Championships, respectively. The results suggest that the predictive models may be a good indicator of future performances; however, the models may have greater efficacy in some weight categories and performance zones than others. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

People living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) need to be able to live well with their condition. The provision of psychosocial interventions (psychological, psychiatric and social care) and physical rehabilitation management is variable across England, as well as the rest of the UK. There is a need for clear recommendations for standards of psychosocial and physical rehabilitation care for people living with CKD, and guidance for the commissioning and measurement of these services. The National Health Service (NHS) England Renal Services Transformation Programme (RSTP) supported a programme of work and modified Delphi process to address the management of psychosocial and physical rehabilitation care as part of a larger body of work to formulate a comprehensive commissioning toolkit for renal care services across England. We sought to achieve expert consensus regarding the psychosocial and physical rehabilitation management of people living with CKD in England and the rest of the UK. Methods. A Delphi consensus method was used to gather and refine expert opinions of senior members of the kidney multi-disciplinary team (MDT) and other key stakeholders in the UK. An agreement was sought on 16 statements reflecting aspects of psychosocial and physical rehabilitation management for people living with CKD. Results. Twenty-six expert practitioners and other key stakeholders, including lived experience representatives, participated in the process. The consensus (>80% affirmative votes) amongst the respondents for all 16 statements was high. Nine recommendation statements were discussed and refined further to be included in the final iteration of the ‘Systems’ section of the NHS England RSTP commissioning toolkit. These priority recommendations reflect pragmatic solutions that can be implemented in renal care and include recommendations for a holistic wellbeing assessment for all people living with CKD who are approaching dialysis, or who are at listing for kidney transplantation, which includes the use of validated measurement tools to assess the need for further intervention in psychosocial and physical rehabilitation management. It is recommended that the scores from these measurement tools be included in the NHS England Renal Data Dashboard. There was also a recommendation for referral as appropriate to NHS Talking Therapies, psychology, counselling or psychotherapy, social work or liaison psychiatry for those with identified psychosocial needs. The use of digital resources was recommended to be used in addition to face-to-face care to provide physical rehabilitation, and all healthcare professionals should be educated to recognize psychosocial and physical rehabilitation needs and refer/sign-post people with CKD to appropriate services. Conclusion. There was high consensus amongst senior members of the kidney MDT and other key stakeholders, including those with lived experience, in the UK on all aspects of the psychosocial and physical rehabilitation management of people living with CKD. The results of this process will be used by NHS England to inform the ‘Systems’ section of the commissioning toolkit and data dashboard and to inform the National Standards of Care for people living with CKD © The Author(s) 2023.

Accuracy is hindered by both marker misplacement and soft-tissue artefact (STA). The effect of the lateral knee marker (KNE) misplacement and STA was determined from a secondary analysis of 13 subjects equipped with a total knee prothesis for which simultaneous dual-plane fluoroscopy and marker-based motion capture was available. In average, STA alone led to 3.3°, 2.9° and 6.7° errors for knee flexion, knee abduction, and the absolute hip rotation respectively. In comparison, marker misplacement led to 0.9°, 4.0° and 12.3° errors for the same kinematics. We showed that STA alone may lead to knee flexion-adduction cross-talk. This finding has clinical repercussions for the use of knee cross talk as a qualitative indicator of knee axis alignment. Our study showed that cumulative effects of marker misplacement and STA affect the transverse plane angles, making challenging to track internal/external rotation with less than 5° of errors. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Conventional Gait Model; Gait analysis; Marker misplacement; Model validity; Soft tissue artefact,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Scopus

A total of 38 faecal samples were collected near farms and local markets where stray dogs were grouping there. Post-slaughtering, the livers of the bovine, camel, cattle, and sheep were examined for cysts. Where 30 suspected hydatid cysts were collected, the number and size of cysts in each liver were recorded. For serology, 23 sera specimens were collected from farmers within the Gaza Strip. According to hospital records in Gaza, 12 patients had attended three different hospitals and had tested positive for hydatid cyst/cystic echinococcosis by CT scans and histopathology. ELISA results from the 23 human patients showed that 3/23 (13%) tested positive for hydatid disease. Of the 30 bovine and cattle harboring cysts, 14/30 (46.6%) were positive for hydatid cyst/cystic echinococcosis of which 23 (76.7%) were males and 7 (23.3%) were females. The present study shows that 6/38 (15.7%) were positive for E. granulosus sensu lato from faecal analysis in dogs. Subsequent sequencing of both dogs and cattle confirmed infection by the G1 strain. The cattle/dog strain (G1) of E.granulosus sensu lato suggests that this infection is cosmopolitan in its distribution. It is concluded that the detection of hydatid cyst/cystic echinococcosis in the examined hosts either human or animals should be considered among physicians and a large sample size is recommended in future research. © 2023",Cattle; Cystic echinococcosis; Dogs; Echinococcus granulosus; G1; Gaza; Genotype; Hydatid,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Scopus

Natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells are involved in the prognoses of CRC. Immunological components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) impact cancer progression and therapeutic responses. We report that CRC patients with higher frequencies of tumor-infiltrating PD-1+ NK and NKT cells had significantly longer disease-free survival (DFS) than patients with lower frequencies. In agreement with that, patients with higher frequencies of tumor-infiltrating PD-1− NK and NKT cells showed shorter DFS.

Joint pain is associated with functional difficulties and may lead to work instability. The aims of this systematic review are to identify: the impact of OA on work participation; and biopsychosocial and work-related factors associated with absenteeism, presenteeism, work transitions, work impairment, work accommodations, and premature work loss. Methods: Four databases were searched, including Medline. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools were used for quality assessment, with narrative synthesis to pool findings due to heterogeneity of study designs and work outcomes. Results: Nineteen studies met quality criteria (eight cohort; 11 cross-sectional): nine included OA of any joint(s), five knee-only, four knee and/or hip, and one knee, hip, and hand OA. All were conducted in high income countries. Absenteeism due to OA was low. Presenteeism rates were four times greater than absenteeism. Performing physically intensive work was associated with absenteeism, presenteeism, and premature work loss due to OA. Moderate-to-severe joint pain and pain interference were associated with presenteeism, work transition, and premature work loss. A smaller number of studies found that comorbidities were associated with absenteeism and work transitions. Two studies reported low co-worker support was associated with work transitions and premature work loss. Conclusions: Physically intensive work, moderate-to-severe joint pain, co-morbidities, and low co-worker support potentially affects work participation in OA. Further research, using longitudinal study designs and examining the links between OA and biopsychosocial factors e.g., workplace accommodations, is needed to identify targets for interventions.

A cross-sectional research study of healthcare students and NHS staff in England,BMJ Open,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179649496&doi=10.1136%2fbmjopen-2023-074226&partnerID=40&md5=18cdd82dd605be2fed969483b978620a,"Objectives This research aimed to understand the prior and current global health participation, current availability of and future interest in participating in global health activities healthcare students and National Health Service (NHS) staff. Design An online survey was conducted on NHS staff and healthcare students in England between July and November 2021. The survey was disseminated to all secondary care providers in the English NHS and universities in England. A volunteer sample of 3955 respondents, including 2936 NHS staff, 683 healthcare students, 172 individuals combining NHS working and study and 164 respondents classified as other. Results Most (80%) respondents had not participated in a global health activity before, with 6% having previously participated, a further 3% currently participating and 11% unsure. Among those who had participated, the most common types of activity were attending global health events (75%). The most common reason for not participating was a limited knowledge of opportunities (78%). When asked about their future interest in global health participation, more than half of respondents (53%) indicated an interest and 8% were not interested. There was an significant proportion (39%) answering unsure, indicating a possible lack of understanding about global health participation. Conclusions Global health has gathered increasing significance in recent years, both in policy and in education and training for healthcare professionals. Despite recognition of the role global learning plays in knowledge enhancement, skill development and knowledge exchange, this study suggests that global health participation remains low among NHS staff and healthcare students. © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

The limitations of resources and accessibility for the individual gave rise to a focused design methodology for delivering a culturally acceptable solution using 3D Printing technology. A series of co-design activities were held in Uganda and provided direct feedback to drive the design of two prototypes based on acceptable aesthetics and priority Activities of Daily Living. Two terminal device prototypes were 3D printed in the UK. These can be directly attached to a standard proximal socket thread. The passive hand was printed in a flexible filament and the prehensor was printed in a durable impact resistant material. Local researchers in Uganda have similar 3D printers, filaments, and assembly hardware, which allowed for concurrent development and refinement of the prototypes. Local participation provides a rich user feedback environment to understand which elements of prosthetic device design are integral to delivering acceptable prosthetics solutions for fabrication in Uganda. 3D printing can provide a viable route to addressing the needs of the user.

In this study, we determined the preliminary reliability and feasibility of a new test, termed the kneeling isometric plantar flexion test (KIPFT), for footballers. Twenty-one male youth footballers (age = 17.8 ± 1.1 years, height = 182 ± 5 cm, weight = 77.6 ± 5.9 kg) from English League One football clubs completed three trials of the KIPFT on a wireless force plate at the end (2022–2023) and start (2023–2024) of the season. The within-session reliability of the peak force (relative to body weight) was good–excellent for both limbs and both occasions. On average, performance of the KIPFT took just over 1 min per limb and ~2 min to set up. The peak force values were larger for the non-dominant limbs only at the start versus the end of the season, but there were no between-limb differences. From these results, it was determined that (1) the KIPFT is feasible, (2) a minimum of 32 footballers would be required to establish its between-session reliability with ≥80% statistical power and (3) large-cohort normative data for the KIPFT may be best collected at the start of the football season. © 2023 by the authors.",calf; force plate; injury; maximal strength; soccer; soleus,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Scopus

The aims of this study were to: examine work limitations of working people with: rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), osteoarthritis, or fibromyalgia using the Workplace Activity Limitations Scale (WALS, a measure of presenteeism); and identify personal, functioning and disability, and work contextual factors associated with presenteeism. Methods: Secondary analysis was conducted of a cross-sectional survey including work outcome measures (WORK-PROM study). A literature review identified variables (coded to ICF) to include in multivariable regressions examining factors associated with presenteeism. Results: Moderate to high WALS scores were identified in: 93.60% with FM; 69.90% OA; 65.20% RA; and 46.80% axSpA (n = 822). Similarities in work limitations were noted across conditions, although some more problematic in specific RMD. Participants received help with about a quarter of activities (27%RA; 25%FM; 23%OA; 17%axSpA) and work adaptations for less than a fifth causing difficulty (18%FM; 14%RA; 14%OA; 9%axSpA). Literature review identified 33 variables in the WORK-PROM dataset to include in multivariable regressions. Factors associated with higher WALS scores were worse: functional limitations, job strain, pain, difficulties with mental-interpersonal job demands, perceived health status, work-life balance, greater need for work accommodations and lack of perceived work support. Discussion: This study extends understanding of work limitations of working people with these four RMD, the extent of help and adaptations received, need for more work accommodation support, and focus on work support, work rehabilitation, and healthy workplace practices to help keep people working. © 2023 The Authors.

This study explored the perceptions and compatibility of current professional guidance by both radiography practitioners and key stakeholders involved in developing the Society and College of Radiographers clinical practice guideline document for caring for people with dementia. Methods: This was a two-stage qualitative multi-method study. Fifteen diagnostic and two therapeutic radiography practitioners from across the UK participated with three asynchronous online discussion forums. One core member and three members from the key stakeholder group participated with individual semi-structured interviews. Data analysis included narrative and thematic analysis. Results: Participants from both stages identified enablers and barriers to providing person-centred care (PCC) to PLWD. Three superordinate themes were identified linked to (1) Challenges in delivering person-centred care to people living with dementia, (2) The need for role specific education and training, and (3) Partnership working with carers. Challenges in delivering care included time and resource pressures. The lack of dementia specific education compounded these difficulties. Care partners were seen as an asset to providing care. Conclusion: Providing PCC to meet the individual needs of PLWD can be challenging in practice. This is often due to time and resource implications. There were also issues with the identification of PLWD prior to their attendance in the department. Carers could help to alleviate some challenges. There is a need for profession specific education and dementia awareness training to support the provision of PCC to PLWD. Implications for practice: Dementia training needs to be specifically tailored for radiography practitioners to bridge the gap between guidelines and clinical practice rather than being generalised from other disciplines. © 2023",Carers; Diagnostic radiography; Education and training; Person-centred care; Therapeutic radiography,,W.B.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of zodiac sign on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) following primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHOD: Patients undergoing primary TKA during a 2-year period (January 2019 to December 2020) were identified retrospectively. Patient demographics, Oxford Knee Score (OKS), EuroQol 5-dimension (EQ-5D) (baseline, 1 and 2 years) and patient satisfaction scores (1 and 2 years) were collected. Each patient's zodiac sign was assigned from their date of birth. RESULTS: There were 509 patients (228 males [44.8%] and 281 females [55.2%]) with a mean age of 70.9 years and a mean BMI of 30.3. There were no significant differences in gender (p=0.712), age (p=0.088), BMI (p=0.660), or pre-operative OKS (p=0.539). Aries and Gemini (0.366) had the worst and Pisces the best (0.595) pre-operative EQ-5D scores (p=0.038). When adjusting for confounding, Aries (p=0.031) had a greater improvement in EQ-5D at 1 year, although this was not maintained at 2 years. When adjusting for confounding, Pisceans had significantly less of an improvement in OKS at both 1 (p=0.022) and 2 years (p=0.042) and also had a significantly lower risk of satisfaction at 2 years (odds ratio 0.41, p=0.043). CONCLUSION: Zodiac sign was associated with outcome following TKA. Pisceans had the best pre-operative EQ-5D scores, but the least improvement in the post-operative joint specific score (OKS) and were less likely to be satisfied, despite achieving an equal improvement in their health-related quality of life (EQ-5D). Aries started with the lowest pre-operative EQ-5D scores but achieved the best scores at 1 year. Our study shows that an individual's zodiac sign may serve as a useful predictive factor for functional outcomes and satisfaction following TKA. However, our findings are the result of multiple testing in a large dataset following a data trawl, and correlation does not necessarily equal causation even in a real-world registry. © PMA.",EQ-5D; Oxford Knee Score; knee; arthroplasty; outcome; zodiac sign; star sign.,,NLM (Medline),Article,Scopus

CMT teaches patients to reconceptualise the condition, integrates muscle biofeedback and aims to reduce muscle overactivity, both in response to pain and during daily activities. This nested qualitative study explored patient and physiotherapist perspectives and experiences of CMT. Methods: Five physiotherapists were trained to follow a well-defined protocol and then delivered CMT to at least two patients with knee osteoarthritis. Each patient received seven individual clinical sessions and was provided with access to online learning materials incorporating animated videos. Semi-structured interviews took place after delivery/completion of the intervention and data were analysed at the patient and physiotherapist level. Results: Five physiotherapists and five patients were interviewed. All described a process of changing beliefs throughout their engagement with CMT. A framework with three phases was developed to organise the data according to how osteoarthritis was conceptualised and how this changed throughout their interactions with CMT. Firstly, was an identification of pain beliefs to be challenged and recognition of how current beliefs can misalign with daily experiences. Secondly was a process of challenging and changing beliefs, validated through new experiences. Finally, there was an embedding of changed beliefs into self-management to continue with activities. Conclusion: This study identified a range of psychological changes which occur during exposure to CMT. These changes enabled patients to reconceptualise their condition, develop a new understanding of their body, understand psychological processes, and make sense of their knee pain. © 2023 The Authors.

Qualitative research offers insights into lived experiences and a deeper understanding of the contextual factors underlying HIV acquisition. We aimed to synthesize qualitative literature on recently acquired HIV.Design:Systematic review and textual narrative synthesis.Methods:We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO and Sociology Database. Articles were screened, and two authors completed full text review and data extraction. Quality appraisal was conducted (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Studies Checklist) and certainty of findings graded (GRADE-CERQual).Results:We reviewed 1890 articles (1554 following de-duplication), excluding 1539. Fifteen articles were included and an additional article was included after updating the search. We identified 15 themes, three of which we have high confidence in: recent acquisition of HIV facilitates understanding of circumstances of HIV acquisition; indeterminate HIV tests generate uncertainty and anxiety; and people with recently acquired HIV are motivated to reduce risk of onward transmission.Conclusions:Our findings highlight the importance of continued research into recently acquired HIV, as well as the need for support to manage the emotional impact of indeterminate test results and negotiate risk reduction. We found no studies exploring sexual risk in the context of recently acquired HIV, or use of pre-exposure prophylaxis or treatment as prevention.

Cable vibration will react on the end-effector, causing attitude deviation of the end-effector. The main objective of this study is to accurately model axially moving flexible cables and characterize the dynamic behaviors of associated compliant CDPRs. Firstly, a model for transverse vibration of the axially moving length-variable cable is developed. On this basis, an original nonlinear dynamic model of the CDPRs able to capture the vibration of the cables and the dynamics of the end-effector is proposed. Secondly, the frequency-amplitude relationship of the CDPR is obtained. Moreover, the significance of the excitation effect caused by the axially moving length-variable cables is demonstrated, by comparing the results with and without excitation effect at different frequencies. It turns out that, as the oscillation frequency of the end-effector increases, the end-effector and cables exhibit the dynamics process from steady state to unstable large-amplitude vibration and finally to stable small-amplitude vibration. This indicates that the dynamics of the CDPR exhibit non-linear characteristics, due to the influence of flexible cables. Finally, the proposed dynamic model of compliant CDPRs is validated by experiments performed in the laboratory. © The Author(s), 2023.

In this commentary, we describe the delivery of a Social Gerontology education program for Geriatric Medicine trainees in the Northwest of England. Education in Social Gerontology—a field that focuses on how social, cultural, economic, and environmental factors shape the lives of older adults—is thought to mitigate against ageism, a pervasive and multifaceted form of discrimination. We describe the rationale for, and context of, the program delivery, before presenting an overview of trainee’s feedback. Thematic analysis of feedback centered around three main themes: knowledge acquisition, change in clinical practice, and enjoyment of the sessions. Trainees (n = 20) reported enjoying the sessions, with 100% likely to recommend to peers. The focus on underserved groups, the novel content of the sessions, which were not taught elsewhere, and the non-medical perspective of the speakers were described as particularly valuable. By sharing our approach and reflecting on the early success of the program, we argue for an increased focus on Social Gerontology in Geriatric Medicine education. © 2023, The Author(s).",Evaluation; Inequality; Postgraduate education; Social Gerontology,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Article,Scopus

However, the question of which treatment works best remains, especially for patients with PTSD stemming from childhood abuse. Using the Personalized Advantage Index (PAI), we explored which patients benefit more from phase-based treatment and which benefit more from direct trauma-focused treatment. Data were obtained from a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a phase-based treatment condition (i.e., eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing [EMDR] therapy preceded by Skills Training in Affect and Interpersonal Regulation [STAIR]; n = 57) and a direct trauma-focused treatment (EMDR only; n = 64) among individuals with PTSD related to childhood abuse. Machine learning techniques were used to examine all pretreatment variables included in the trial as potential predictors and moderators, with selected variables combined to build the PAI model. The utility of the PAI was tested by comparing actual posttreatment outcomes of individuals who received PAI-indicated treatment with those allocated to a non–PAI-indicated treatment. Although eight pretreatment variables between PTSD treatment outcome and treatment condition were selected as moderators, there was no significant difference between participants assigned to their PAI-indicated treatment and those randomized to a non–PAI-indicated treatment, d = 0.25, p =.213. Hence, the results of this study do not support the need for personalized medicine for patients with PTSD and a history of childhood abuse.

Drawing from a well-founded, diverse evidence base is salient to constructive evaluation and any subsequent recommendations being fit for purpose. Design: This study employed a practice-based quantitative design to explore therapeutic gains in adult counselling clients attending person-centred therapy (n = 301), delivered in a charitable, community-based UK service. Measures: Outcome measures PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were used from three time points: initial assessment (IA), first ongoing session and last or 6th ongoing appointment (whichever occurred first; T1, T2 and T3). Analysis: Repeated measures ANOVA, CSI, RI and RCSI calculations were used to consider significant change in clients. Findings: Reductions in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 outcome measures were observed over time (between T2 & T3 and T1 & T3) and were all statistically significant (p = <0.001). By T3: CSI was achieved by 48.1% of clients on PHQ-9 and 50.8% of clients on GAD-7, RI was achieved by 47.8% of clients on PHQ-9 and 60.5% of clients on GAD-7, and RCSI was achieved by 32.6% of clients on PHQ-9 and 41.2% of clients on GAD-7.

This study established the distribution of heart and respiratory rates of children using a large data set to inform debate on what the ‘normal’ range of these should look like. The primary aim was to compare the distribution of heart and respiratory rates measured in children recruited from non-tertiary emergency care settings with those published by Advanced Paediatric Life Support (APLS). The secondary aim was to compare the distribution of this study's data set to other national guidance on what constitutes a severe (high-risk) measurement and previously published data sets. Method: Prospective study using anonymised patient data, extracted from electronic patient records of children and young people 0–16 years, recruited from three Emergency Departments and one Urgent Care Centre in Northwest England, UK. Results: Heart and respiratory rates, including the reporting of values at certain centiles and comparisons of averages. Distribution of heart and respiratory rate were consistently higher than those used by the APLS guidance, resulting in a large proportion exceeding the ‘severe’ cut-offs proposed. This varied greatly by age. Conclusions: This study's data set suggests normal heart rate ranges proposed by the APLS and others is too low and therefore ‘abnormal’ measurements encompass too large a proportion. The respiratory rate of this data set was more consistent with the guidelines and other published data sets. © 2023 The Authors.

A secondary aim was to investigate preliminary relationships between patient-related factors and clinical outcomes at 12- and 26- weeks. Design: feasibility cohort. Setting: Australian healthcare settings. Methods: Participants with AT receiving physiotherapy in Australia were recruited via treating physiotherapists and online. Data were collected online at baseline, 12- and 26-weeks. Progression criteria for a full-scale study were recruitment rate of ≥10 per month, conversion rate ≥20%, and response rate to questionnaires ≥80%. The relationship between patient-related factors and clinical outcomes was investigated using Spearman's rho correlation coefficient. Results: The average recruitment rate was 5/month, conversion rate was 97%, and response rate to questionnaires was ≥97% at all timepoints. There was a fair to moderate correlation (rho = 0.225 to 0.683) between patient-related factors and clinical outcomes at the 12-week, but no to weak correlation at the 26-week (rho = 0.002 to 0.284).

We used a ddRADseq approach to generate genome-wide SNP markers for 171 individuals from all putative extant species of Sapajus to access their evolutionary history. Using maximum likelihood, multispecies coalescent phylogenetic inference, and a Bayes Factor method to test for alternative hypotheses of species delimitation, we inferred the phylogenetic history of the Sapajus radiation, evaluating the number of discrete species supported. Our results support the recognition of three species from the Atlantic Forest south of the São Francisco River, with these species being the first splits in the robust capuchin radiation. Our results were congruent in recovering the Pantanal and Amazonian Sapajus as structured into three monophyletic clades, though new morphological assessments are necessary, as the Amazonian clades do not agree with previous morphology-based taxonomic distributions. Phylogenetic reconstructions for Sapajus occurring in the Cerrado, Caatinga, and northeastern Atlantic Forest were less congruent with morphology-based phylogenetic reconstructions, as the bearded capuchin was recovered as a paraphyletic clade, with samples from the Caatinga biome being either a monophyletic clade or nested with the blond capuchin monkey. © 2023 by the authors.",ddRADseq; evolutionary history; Neotropical primates; phylogenomic,,MDPI,Article,Scopus

During basic training military recruits are introduced to marching “in-step”, and thus the requirement to walk at fixed speeds and step-lengths. The extent to which individuals are required to under- or over-stride will vary depending on their stature, and the stature of others in their section. The incidence of stress fractures in female recruits undergoing basic training is higher than that for their male counterparts. Research question: Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine how joint kinematics and kinetics are affected by walking speed, step-length, and sex. Methods: Thirty-seven (19 female) aerobically active non-injured individuals volunteered for this study. Synchronised three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data were collected while participants walked overground at prescribed speeds. Audio and visual cues were used to control step-lengths. Linear mixed models were run to analyse the effects of speed, step-length condition, and sex on peak joint moments. Results and Significance: The findings of this study showed that, in general, walking faster and over-striding predominantly increased peak joint moments, suggesting that over-striding is more likely to negatively affect injury risk than under-striding. This is especially important for individuals unaccustomed to over-striding as the cumulative effect of increased joint moments may affect a muscles capability to withstand the increased external forces associated with walking faster and with longer step-lengths, which could then lead to an increased risk of developing an injury. © 2023",Joint Moments; Kinetics; Sex Differences; Walking,,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

Xenosurveillance is an epidemiological approach to assessing human infection risks performed by screening vectors of infectious disease agents. In the proof-of-principle study reported herein, the DNA of 23 human lice was collected from the clothes of 30 homeless Ethiopian individuals. These samples were assessed using 16S rRNA gene-specific pan-eubacterial PCR for screening, followed by Bartonella genus 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence-specific PCR, Bartonella genus gltA gene-specific PCR, and 16S rRNA gene PCR with specificity for relapsing-fever-associated Borrelia spp. with subsequent sequencing of the amplicons. In one sample, the pan-eubacterial 16S rRNA gene-specific screening PCR, the Bartonella genus 16S-23S ITS sequence-specific PCR, and the Bartonella genus gltA gene-specific PCR allowed for the sequencing of B. quintana-specific amplicons. In two additional samples, Bartonella genus gltA gene-specific PCR also provided sequences showing 100% sequence identity with B. quintana. In total, 3/23 (13.0%) of the assessed lice were found to be positive for B. quintana. Correlating clinical data were not available; however, the assessment confirmed the presence of B. quintana in the local louse population and thus an associated infection pressure. Larger-sized cross-sectional studies seem advisable to more reliably quantify the infection risk of lice-infested local individuals. The need for prevention by providing opportunities to maintain standard hygiene for Ethiopian homeless individuals is stressed by the reported findings, especially in light of the ongoing migration of refugees. © 2023 by the authors.",Bartonella quintana; Ethiopia; infection risk; Pediculus humanus; vector; xenosurveillance,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Scopus

Peak running speeds in professional male football: Influence of division and playing position. J Strength Cond Res 37(3): 636-640, 2023 - Well-established physical demands of competitive professional football facilitate prescription and monitoring of training. However, many factors influence these physical demands with implications for efficacious practice. Match-play data were analyzed over 2 seasons using global positioning systems technology, differentiating English Championship (33 matches) and League One (27 matches) demands. Playing position categorized wide and central defenders and midfielders and forwards. Peak running speeds defined the outcome measure, assessing the influence of the competition level and playing position across 1, 5, and 10-minute rolling average durations using a linear mixed model. Significant effects were detected for the competition level (F1,324.5= 5.44, p = 0.02) and playing position (F4,328.3= 89.90, p < 0.001). League One matches demonstrated greater peak running speeds than Championship matches (mean difference = 2.72 m·min-1[95% confidence intervals: 0.4, 5.0]). No difference was observed between central and wide midfielders (mean difference = 0.62 m·min-1[95% confidence intervals: -3.1, 4.3]). Wide midfielders presented faster peak running speeds than forwards (mean difference = 18 m·min-1[95% confidence intervals:14.1, 22.1], p < 0.05), central defenders (mean difference = 25 m·min-1[95% confidence intervals: 21.7, 29.8], p < 0.05), and wide defenders (mean difference = 12 m·min-1[95% confidence intervals: 8.2, 16.5], p < 0.05). Interaction effects were found for division*position (F4,328.3= 2.57, p = 0.038) demonstrating greater running speeds in League One, except for central defenders. Wide midfielders presented greater peak 1-minute running speeds, whereas 5 and 10-minute peak running speeds were greatest in central midfielders. The sensitivity of peak running speeds to competition level and playing position has implications for training prescription, monitoring particularly when transitioning between competition levels, determining and monitoring positional training intensities, and objective targets for progressive overload during rehabilitation. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

The aim of the study was to create core anatomical knowledge and skills learning objectives to inform knowledge and skills for entry-level physiotherapists in the UK. A two phased modified Delphi methodology created a consensual anatomy curriculum. A Research-Team-Expert-Panel of four physiotherapists who teach anatomy proposed Anatomy Learning Objectives (Anat-LOs) and accompanying clinical rationales relevant for newly qualified entry-level physiotherapists. A Teacher-Expert-Panel of nine physiotherapists who taught anatomy to physiotherapy students in the UK reviewed Anat-LOs in two consecutive Delphi Rounds, and rated and commented on each Anat-LO. After each Delphi Round, the Research-Team-Expert-Panel reviewed the ratings and comments from the Teacher-Expert-Panel and banked Anat-LOs that passed the 85% acceptance threshold. There were 182 banked Anat-LOs that spanned all eight areas: Introductory Concepts, Principles and Basic Histology; Head and Neck; Thorax; Abdomen, Pelvis and Perineum; Upper Limb; Lower Limb; Spine; and Neuroanatomy regions/systems. The Anat-LOs develop both anatomical knowledge and key anatomical skills, such as palpation and conducting manual tests on model patients. A first ever core anatomy curriculum for entry-level physiotherapists has been created for entry-level physiotherapists, typically Band-5 NHS physiotherapists, and takes an integrated learning approach. The anatomy curriculum brings clarity to students, teachers, clinical supervisors and future employers on the expected anatomical standards for entry-level physiotherapists. © 2023 American Association of Clinical Anatomists and British Association of Clinical Anatomists.",anatomy syllabus; entry-level physiotherapists; UK,,John Wiley and Sons Inc,Article,Scopus

The use of advanced technology has resulted in independent learning skills becoming increasingly important. Many studies have reported a positive correlation between independent learning and success rates in an e-learning environment. This paper focuses on the potential contribution of augmented reality, which superimposes layers of virtual content on real physical objects. The paper initially presents a narrative literature review to identify augmented reality's strengths and challenges in facilitating independent learning and highlights several potential approaches for utilizing augmented reality in nursing education. However, it also reveals a lack of studies integrating augmented reality and independent learning theories such as self-regulated learning.

The international ISupport collaboration aimed to develop standards to outline and explain good procedural practice and the rights of children within the context of a clinical procedure. The rights-based standards for children undergoing tests, treatments, investigations, examinations and interventions were developed using an iterative, multi-phased, multi-method and multi-stakeholder consensus building approach. This consensus approach used a range of online and face to face methods across three phases to ensure ongoing engagement with multiple stakeholders. The views and perspectives of 203 children and young people, 78 parents and 418 multi-disciplinary professionals gathered over a two year period (2020–2022) informed the development of international rights-based standards for the care of children having tests, treatments, examinations and interventions. The standards are the first to reach international multi-stakeholder consensus on definitions of supportive and restraining holds. Conclusion: This is the first study of its kind which outlines international rights-based procedural care standards from multi-stakeholder perspectives. The standards offer health professionals and educators clear evidence-based tools to support discussions and practice changes to challenge prevailing assumptions about holding or restraining children and instead encourage a focus on the interests and rights of the child. What is Known: • Children continue to experience short and long-term harm when undergoing clinical procedures despite increased evidence of the need to improve the provision of child-centred care. • Professionals report uncertainty and tensions in applying evidence-based practice to children’s procedural care. What is New: • This is the first study of its kind which has developed international rights-based procedural care standards from multi-stakeholder perspectives. • The standards are the first to reach international multi-stakeholder consensus on definitions of supportive and restraining holds. © 2023, The Author(s).",Child rights; Children; Consensus; Procedures; Restraint,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Article,Scopus

This study explores the perspectives of a small sample of individuals with FASD regarding the factors that predispose them to encounters with the CJS, and their experiences during investigative interviews. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten individuals with FASD, aged between 12 and 46 years old (mean age 20.1 years). Interviews were a combination of remote audio-recorded, video-recorded, and face-to-face interviews administered by parents/carers. NVivo was used to collate, organise, and explore data. Data were analysed by reflexive thematic analysis. Results: Three over-arching themes were generated from seven sub-themes: “personality/individual triggers to CJS encounters” which described vulnerabilities, such as a tendency to be impulsive and to accept suggestions, “encounters ‘fuelled’ by society” where examples of exploitation, police's aggressive approach and lack of knowledge were given. The final theme of “sense of self-awareness” demonstrated that participants had a sense of appreciation of their strengths and abilities. Conclusion: Individuals with FASD are highly vulnerable to, and within, encounters with the CJS. Procedural justice will benefit by employing alternative methods in dealing with situations where individuals with FASD may be involved, and in obtaining information via interviews from the FASD population. © 2023 The Authors",Criminal justice system; FAS; FASD; Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder; Fetal alcohol syndrome; Forensic context; Investigative interview; Police interview; Vulnerability,,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

Registries usually only capture PFFs that result in revision, missing those managed non-operatively or treated by open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). This study reports the long-term rate of PFF with the original triple-tapered C-stem femoral implant. Materials and methods: A prospective review of a consecutive series of 500 primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs) performed at a single centre between March 2000 and December 2005, with average follow-up of 15 years (12–19 years). Results: There were 500 consecutive THAs in 455 patients. Seven PFFs (1.4%) occurred in seven patients at an average of 7.9 years (range 2–11.5) from the primary arthroplasty. Five PFFs were managed by ORIF, one Vancouver B3 fracture was revised for a loose implant and one patient was treated non-operatively. Average age at primary operation was 74 years (67–87) and BMI averaged 27.3 (22–31). There was no typical fracture pattern and no statistically significant associations with patient demographics (age, gender, BMI, diagnosis) or prosthetic details (size, offset, alignment, cement mantle, subsidence). Survivorship to the occurrence of PFF was 99% (97.3–99.6%) at 10 years and 97.8% (95.5–99.0%) at 15. Conclusion: A PFF rate of 1.4% at an average follow-up of 15 years represents the true incidence of PFF with the use of the original triple-tapered C-Stem femoral implant, similar to that of published Exeter series (1.85%) but lower than the CPT (3.3%). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Cemented; Hip arthroplasty; Periprosthetic femoral fracture; Polished; Taper-slip,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Article,Scopus

While there is much research on both psychological injury and physical injury, the challenges of transition relating to the intersection between the two has received less attention. This article reports on the first phase of a 2-year funded study with the aim to understand the lived experiences of veterans who have been discharged from service with a physical injury or illness and the impacts of this on their mental health. Methods Using a qualitative methodology, 22 veterans who had been discharged from service within the last 8 years were interviewed to identify key aspects of their experience of the transition process. Results The article highlights two key themes: how some veterans adjusted to life with a physical injury or condition; and, the intersections that became apparent between physical injury and mental health. The challenges that veterans faced were shaped by the transition process and by the way in which the medical discharge process was conducted. Conclusions Consideration of improvements to the medical discharge process could influence better outcomes for those who have left with a physical injury or illness and later find themselves struggling with mental health issues.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.",depression & mood disorders; orthopaedic & trauma surgery; qualitative research,,BMJ Publishing Group,Article,Scopus

Methods: Rheumatology therapists, following vocational rehabilitation (VR) training, assessed participants in the WORKWELL VR trial using the WES-RC. Data were extracted from the WES-RC to identify the frequency of workplace barriers, and from trial baseline questionnaires (e.g., Work Limitations Questionnaire-25 (WLQ-25). Barriers reported by ≤5 participants were considered for removal. WES-RC content validity was assessed by linking to the International Classification of Functioning, Health, and Disability Core Set for VR (ICF-VR). Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's α and concurrent validity by correlating the total number of workplace barriers reported with WLQ-25 scores. Results: WES-RCs were completed with 116 employed participants: 79% women, age 48.72 (SD 9.49) years, and 57% working full-time. The WES-RC was reduced to 121 barriers. Content validity was good, with 73/90 ICF-VR items linked. Cronbach's α = 0.92, that is, suitable for individual use. Concurrent validity was moderate: WLQ-25 (rs = 0.40). The three most common barriers were Physical Job Demands (100%: e.g., mobility 99%; hand use 74%), Mental, Time, Energy, Emotional Job Demands (91%, e.g., concentration 47%, remembering 41%); Getting Ready for and Travel to Work (87%, e.g., driving 60%). Conclusion: The WES-RC (UK) has good content validity, reliability, and concurrent validity. The wide range of barriers emphasises the need for biopsychosocial work rehabilitation. © 2023 The Authors.

Longitudinal development of sprint performance and force-velocity-power characteristics: influence of biological maturation. J Strength Cond Res 37(11): 2178-2184, 2023 - This study was designed to investigate the influence of biological maturation on the longitudinal development of sprint performance. Thirty-two subjects performed 2 assessments of maximal sprint performance that were separated by 18 months. Each sprint assessment was measured through a radar gun that collected instantaneous velocity with the velocity-time data used to derive sprint times and force-velocity-power characteristics. The biological maturity of each subject was assessed using a predictive equation, and subjects were grouped according to predicted years from peak height velocity (circa-PHV: -1.0 to 1.0; post-PHV: >1.0). A 2 × 2 mixed model analysis of variance was used to assess group × time interactions, and paired t-tests were used to assess the longitudinal changes for each maturity group. No significant group × time interactions were observed for any sprint time or force-velocity-power characteristic. The circa-PHV group experienced significant within-group changes in maximal theoretical velocity (6.35 vs. 5.47%; effect size [ES] = 1.26 vs. 0.52) and 5-m sprint time (-3.63% vs. -2.94%; ES = -0.64 vs. -0.52) compared with the post-PHV group. There was no significant change in the magnitude of relative theoretical maximum force in either group; however, both the circa-PHV and post-PHV groups significantly improved the orientation of force production at the start of the sprint (RFmax [4.91 vs. 4.46%; ES = 0.79 vs. 0.74, respectively]). Considering these findings, it is recommended that practitioners adopt training methods aimed to improve relative lower-limb force production, such as traditional strength training and sled pulling and pushing, to improve sprint performance and relative theoretical maximum force. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

T cells play crucial roles in shaping CRC, and their presence in the tumor microenvironment (TME) has proven to be one of the best predictors of clinical outcomes. A crucial component of the immune system is cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CTLs), which play decisive roles in the prognosis of CRC. In this study, we investigated associations of immune checkpoints expressed on tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells with disease-free survival (DFS) in 45 naïve-treatment CRC patients. First, we examined the associations of single ICs, and found that CRC patients with higher levels of T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM-domain (TIGIT), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3) and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) CD8+ T cells tended to have longer DFS. Interestingly, when PD-1 expression was combined with other ICs, there were more evident and stronger associations between higher levels of PD-1+ with TIGIT+ or PD-1+ with TIM-3+ tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and longer DFS. Our findings for TIGIT were validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) CRC dataset. This study is the first to report on the association of co-expression of PD-1 with TIGIT and PD-1 with TIM-3 in CD8+ T cells and improved DFS in treatment-naïve CRC patients. This work highlights the significance of immune checkpoint expression on tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells as critical predictive biomarkers, especially when co-expression of different ICs is considered. © 2023 The Author(s)",CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells; Colorectal cancer; Disease-free survival; Immune checkpoints; Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes,,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

Previous research has been undertaken primarily by biomechanists experienced with S-SC evaluations. Little is known about the agreement between various sports science and medicine practitioners to ascertain whether the tool can be used effectively by different practitioners in the field. Currently, the CMAS uses three camera views (CVS) to undertake the evaluation, and it would be worthwhile to know whether the CMAS can be effectively conducted with fewer camera views to improve clinical utility. Therefore, the aim of the study was to examine the inter-rater agreement between different sports science and medicine practitioners and agreement between using different CVS to evaluate the S-SC technique using the CMAS. Methods: Video data were collected from 12 male rugby union players performing a 45° S-SC manoeuvre toward both the left and right directions. Five different sports science and medicine practitioners evaluated footage from three cameras of one left and one right trial from each player using the CMAS. Twelve different trials were also evaluated by the sports rehabilitator using single and multiple CVS. Agreements (percentage; Kappa coefficients (K)) between different practitioners and configurations of the CVS were explored. Results: Good to excellent inter-rater agreements were found between all practitioners for total score (K = 0.63–0.84), with moderate to excellent inter-rater agreements observed across all items of the CMAS (K = 0.5–1.0). Excellent agreement was found between using three CVS vs. two CVS that included at least a sagittal view (K = 0.96–0.97). Lower agreement (K = 0.83) was found between angle-frontal views with three CVS. Conclusions: The CMAS can be used effectively by various practitioners to evaluate the movement quality of S-SC. The use of two CVS that include at least a sagittal plane view would suffice to evaluate the S-SC technique against the CMAS. © 2023 by the authors.",anterior cruciate ligament; injury risk screening; knee; qualitative analysis; side-step cut,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Scopus

Individuals with IC and matched controls [sex, age ±5 years, home < 5 miles] wore an activity monitor (activPAL) and carried a GPS device (AMOD-AGL3080) for 7 days. GPS data categorised walking events as occurring at home (<=50 m from home co-ordinates) or away from home, and indoors (signal to noise ratio <= 212 dB) or outdoors. Number of walking events, walking duration, steps and cadence were compared between groups and each location pair using mixed model ANOVAs. In addition, the locus of activity (distance from home) at which walking was conducted was compared between groups. Participants (n = 56) were mostly male (64%) and aged 54–89 years. Individuals with IC spent significantly less time walking and took fewer steps than their matched controls at all locations, including at home. Participants spent more time and took more steps away from home than at home, but were similar when walking indoors and outdoors. The locus of activity was significantly smaller for individuals with IC, suggesting that it is not just physical capacity that influences walking behaviour, and other factors (e.g., social isolation) may play a role. © 2023 by the authors.",GPS; intermittent claudication; location; physical activity; walking,,MDPI,Article,Scopus

No human cases have been recorded since the 1980s but there is a need to establish if the parasite has been completely eliminated from domestic animals. A study was carried out in 2018/2019 to identify dogs infected with E. granulosus using copro-antigen and copro-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. In addition, annual slaughter data were analysed to establish infection levels of E. granulosus and 2 other taeniid parasites. Results showed that 4 out of 589 dogs (0.7%) tested positive by copro-antigen analysis. Results from similar surveys carried out in 2010, 2012 and 2014 showed 17 (3%), 0 and 6 (1%) copro-antigen-positive dogs, respectively, with 8 dogs being confirmed by PCR in 2010. Annual abattoir data showed that from 2006 to 2020, 36 sheep were identified with E. granulosus (mean 0.0055%), 14 186 sheep with Taenia hydatigena (mean 2.2%) and 465 with Taenia ovis (mean 0.072%). Prevalences of T. hydatigena and T. ovis showed spontaneous rises in certain years where the infections could also be detected in lambs indicating that viable taeniid eggs were present. Observations of farm management procedures indicated that there were occasions when dogs could get access to infective taeniid material. In conclusion, E. granulosus is still present in sheep and dogs but at low prevalences. The increasing presence of T. hydatigena however, indicates that control measures are defective in some areas and there is potential for a re-emergence of CE.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Lewin M.; Price C.; Nester C.,Can a shoe-mounted IMU identify the effects of orthotics in ways comparable to gait laboratory measurements?,Journal of Foot and Ankle Research,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169759324&doi=10.1186%2fs13047-023-00654-8&partnerID=40&md5=e3a0b5ca143cb5fe42bf989454446576,"Background: Footwear and orthotic research has traditionally been conducted within laboratories. With increasing prevalence of wearable sensors for foot and ankle biomechanics measurement, transitioning experiments into the real-world is realistic. However wearable systems must effectively detect the direction and magnitude of response to interventions to be considered for future usage. Methods: RunScribe IMU was used simultaneously with motion capture, accelerometers, and force plates during straight-line walking. Three orthotics (A, B, C) were used to change lower limb biomechanics from a control (SHOE) including: Ground reaction force (GRF) loading rate (A), pronation excursion (A and B), maximum pronation velocity (A and B), and impact shock (C) to test whether RunScribe detected effects consistent with laboratory measurements. Sensitivity was evaluated by assessing: 1. Significant differences (t-test) and effect sizes (Cohen’s d) between measurement systems for the same orthotic, 2. Statistical significance (t-test and ANOVA) and effect size (Cohen’s d & f) for orthotic effect across measurement systems 3. Direction of orthotic effect across measurement systems. Results: GRF loading rate (SHOE: p = 0.138 d = 0.403, A: p = 0.541 d = 0.165), impact shock (SHOE: p = 0.177 d = 0.405, C: p = 0.668 d = 0.132), pronation excursion (A: p = 0.623 d = 0.10, B: p = 0.986 d = 0.00) did not significantly differ between measurement systems with low effect size. Significant differences and high effect sizes existed between systems in the control condition for pronation excursion (p = 0.005 d = 0.68), and all conditions for pronation velocity (SHOE: p < 0.001 d = 1.24, A: p = 0.001 p = 1.21, B: p = 0.050 d = 0.64). RunScribe (RS) and Laboratory (LM) recorded the same significant effect of orthotic but inconsistent effect sizes for GRF loading rate (LM: p = 0.020 d = 0.54, RS: p = 0.042 d = 0.27), pronation excursion (LM: p < 0.001 f = 0.31, RS: p = 0.042 f = 0.15), and non-significant effect of orthotic for impact shock (LM: p = 0.182 d = 0.08, RS: p = 0.457 d = 0.24). Statistical significance was different between systems for effect of orthotic on pronation velocity (LM: p = 0.010 f = 0.18, RS: p = 0.093 f = 0.25). RunScribe and Laboratory agreed on the direction of change of the biomechanics variables for 69% (GRF loading rate), 40%—70% (pronation excursion), 47%—65% (pronation velocity), and 58% (impact shock) of participants. Conclusion: The RunScribe shows sensitivity to orthotic effect consistent with the laboratory at the group level for GRF loading rate, pronation excursion, and impact shock during walking. There were however large discrepancies between measurements in individuals. Application of the RunScribe for group analysis may be appropriate, however implementation of RunScribe for individual assessment and those including pronation may lead to erroneous interpretation. © 2023, The College of Podiatry and the Australasian Podiatry Council.",Footwear; Orthotics; Sensitivity; Validation; Wearables,,BioMed Central Ltd,Article,Scopus

Design Qualitative interviews informed by normalisation process theory to understand how the Hub model became embedded into normal practice, and factors that disrupted normalisation of this approach. Setting Three Resilience Hubs in the North of England. Participants Hub staff, keyworkers who accessed Hub support (Hub clients), keyworkers who had not accessed a Hub, and wider stakeholders involved in the provision of staff support within the health and care system (N=63). Results Hubs were generally seen as an effective way of supporting keyworkers, and Hub clients typically described very positive experiences. Flexibility and adaptability to local needs were strongly valued. Keyworkers accessed support when they understood the offer, valuing a confidential service that was separate from their organisation. Confusion about how Hubs differed from other support prevented some from enrolling. Beliefs about job roles, unsupportive managers, negative workplace cultures and systemic issues prevented keyworkers from valuing mental health support. Lack of support from managers discouraged keyworker engagement with Hubs. Black, Asian and minority ethnic keyworkers impacted by racism felt that the Hubs did not always meet their needs. Conclusions Hubs were seen as a valuable, responsive and distinct part of the health and care system. Findings highlight the importance of improving promotion and accessibility of Hubs, and continuation of confidential Hub support. Policy implications for the wider health and care sector include the central importance of genuine promotion of and value placed on mental health support by health and social care management, and the creation of psychologically safe work environments. Diversity and cultural competency training is needed to better reach under-represented communities. Findings are consistent with the international literature, therefore, likely to have applicability outside of the current context.  © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

Ibeggazene S.; Pymer S.; Birkett S.T.; Caldow E.; Harwood A.E.,A systematic review of exercise intervention reporting quality and dose in studies of intermittent claudication,Vascular,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124914468&doi=10.1177%2f17085381211070700&partnerID=40&md5=cc3bcf78d1f1efe41555d1339161be87,"Background: Exercise therapy is an important treatment option for people with intermittent claudication (IC). Appropriate reporting of exercise interventions in populations with IC within randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is important to ensure that research can be translated into clinical practice. Therefore, the purpose of our review is to evaluate the reporting of exercise interventions in RCTs of exercise therapy in patients with IC. Methods: A systematic search was performed to identify relevant trials in patients with IC published until May 2020. Studies including only participants with critical limb ischaemia or asymptomatic peripheral artery disease were excluded. Each trial was scored using the recently developed ‘Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template’ (CERT) which has a maximum obtainable score of 19. Results: Of 1489 unique records identified from the search, 73 trials were included, reporting 107 exercise interventions. Overall, the average CERT score was 10/19. The exercise equipment used, the use of supervision and a description of whether the exercise prescription was tailored or generic were the most frequently reported intervention components. The motivational strategies used, intervention adherence and intervention fidelity were the most underreported CERT components. There was no trend indicating that CERT scores were higher in more recent publications. Conclusions: We have identified that important details about exercise interventions are frequently missing from the published literature. These missing data hinder replication of research findings and limit the translation of evidence into clinical practice. © The Author(s) 2022.",exercise; exercise therapy; Intermittent claudication; systematic review,,SAGE Publications Ltd,Article,Scopus
