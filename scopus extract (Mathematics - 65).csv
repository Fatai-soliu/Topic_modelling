Several features are shown in this design including softness, lightweight, and shape change. The robot that has been designed in this article is constructed with four identical contraction actuators: one pair for steering and moving forward and the second pair for shape-shifting. The proposed mobile robot has the ability to move forward, steer, and shapeshift to navigate through narrow paths. The kinematic for the system is provided for the area of the robot by using the shoelace formula by utilising a Pixy camera to track the coordinates of the four vertices. © 2022 by the authors.",mobile robot; narrow path; pneumatic artificial muscle (PAM); shapeshift; soft robotics,Mathematics,MDPI,Article,Scopus

Motivated by studying the near-wall transport phenomena in such applications, the present article examines the simultaneous influence of thermal radiative flux and magneto-hydrodynamics on two-dimensional electrically conducting natural convective turbulent heat transfer about a vertical surface under a transverse static magnetic field using the low Reynolds number kinetic energy and dissipation (k–ε) model. An optimized Crank–Nicolson finite difference method is applied to solve the nonlinear and coupled system of Reynolds-averaged boundary layer equations. Numerical computations are conducted to visualize the streamlines and heatlines in laminar and turbulent regimes via mathematical stream and heat functions based on the Bejan approach. A detailed parametric study of the effects of the magnetic field, radiative flux, and turbulent Reynolds number on flow average velocity, temperature, kinetic energy, and dissipation rate is conducted. The simulations reveal that an increase in the magnetic field intensity reduces the average velocity and dissipation rate, whereas an increase in thermal radiation decreases the time mean temperature. The study also includes contour plots of turbulence energy and dissipation rate, along with skin friction coefficient and Nusselt number. The obtained numerical outcomes are compared to previous literature, and a good agreement is found. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Bejan heatline visualization; free convection; k–ε model; low Reynolds number; magnetic field; thermal radiation; turbulence; vertical plate,Mathematics,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,Article,Scopus

The momentum equation features electrical and magnetic body force terms, and the Darcy–Brinkman–Forchheimer mode is used for non-Darcy effects. The energy balance equation includes thermal buoyancy (natural convection body force) and a modified viscous dissipation term. The conservation equations with associated boundary conditions are reframed into a system of coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations via appropriate similarity transformations. The emerging dimensionless boundary value problem is then solved with a differential transform method (DTM). Validation of DTM solutions with the bvp4c MATLAB collocation solver is included. The influence of key parameters on velocity, temperature and average Nusselt number, are computed and illustrated graphically. With elevation in Weissenberg (non-Newtonian) number, velocity and temperature are reduced. Velocity is suppressed with increasing non-Darcian parameter (Forchheimer effect) whereas it is enhanced with increment in buoyancy convection parameter. With increasing Forchheimer, Darcy number and Hartmann number, the average Nusselt number is boosted whereas it is decreased with higher values of buoyancy convection parameter, Brinkman number and Weissenberg number. A strong reduction in temperature is computed with increment in ratio of Joule electrical heating to heat conduction parameter. DTM is shown to be an exceptionally accurate and versatile approach for simulating non-Newtonian electromagnetohydrodynamic transport in ducts. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",,Mathematics,John Wiley and Sons Inc,Article,Scopus

Self-supervised learning can be divided into two main categories: Generative and Contrastive methods. While Generative methods mainly focus on reconstructing data, Contrastive learning methods refine data representations by leveraging the contrast between each sample and its augmented version. However, existing Contrastive learning methods for anomalous sound detection often have two main problems. The first one is that they mostly rely on simple augmentation techniques, such as time or frequency masking, which may introduce biases due to the limited diversity of real-world sounds and noises encountered in practical scenarios (e.g., factory noises combined with machine sounds). The second issue is dimension collapsing, which leads to learning a feature space with limited representation. To address the first shortcoming, we suggest a diffusion-based data augmentation method that employs ChatGPT and AudioLDM. Also, to address the second concern, we put forward a two-stage self-supervised model. In the first stage, we introduce a novel approach that combines Contrastive learning and masked autoencoders to pre-train on the MIMII and ToyADMOS2 datasets. This combination allows our model to capture both global and local features, leading to a more comprehensive representation of the data. In the second stage, we refine the audio representations for each machine ID by employing supervised Contrastive learning to fine-tune the pre-trained model. This process enhances the relationship between audio features originating from the same machine ID. Experiments show that our method outperforms most of the state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods. Our suggested model achieves an average AUC and pAUC of 94.39% and 87.93% on the DCASE 2020 Challenge Task2 dataset, respectively. © 2023 by the authors.",anomalous sound detection; Contrastive learning; diffusion-based data augmentation; masked autoencoders; Variance—Covariance Regularization,Mathematics,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Scopus

Today, it is a cornerstone of image classification. We propose a novel dictionary learning method to recognise images of handwritten numbers. Our focus is to maximise the sparse-representation and discrimination power of the class-specific dictionaries. We, for the first time, adopt a new feature space, i.e., histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), to generate dictionary columns (atoms). The HOG features robustly describe fine details of hand-writings. We design an objective function followed by a minimisation technique to simultaneously incorporate these features. The proposed cost function benefits from a novel class-label penalty term constraining the associated minimisation approach to obtain class-specific dictionaries. The results of applying the proposed method on various handwritten image databases in three different languages show enhanced classification performance (∼98%) compared to other relevant methods. Moreover, we show that combination of HOG features with dictionary learning enhances the accuracy by 11% compared to when raw data are used. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves comparable results to that of existing deep learning models under the same experimental conditions but with a fraction of parameters. © 2022 The Author(s)",Deep learning; Dictionary learning; Handwritten recognition; Histogram of oriented gradients; Image classification,Mathematics,Elsevier Inc.,Article,Scopus

This problem is motivated by emulsion hydrodynamics in chemical engineering where rheological behaviour often arises in addition to porous media effects. The non-Newtonian Stokes’ couple stress fluid model features couple stresses and body couples that are absent in the classical Navier–Stokes viscous model. It provides a robust framework for simulating emulsions, complex suspensions and other liquids which possess microstructure. The physical regime is delineated into two zones – the interior of the semi-permeable zone (region II) which engulfs the solid core and the external couple stress fluid zone (region I). The model is formulated using a spherical polar coordinate system in terms of the stream function ψ. The Brinkman-extended Darcy model is deployed for the porous medium hydrodynamics and isotropic permeability is considered. Analytical expressions are derived for dimensionless pressure, tangential stress and the couple stress components using the method of separation of variables and Gegenbauer functions of the first kind. The integration constants are evaluated with appropriate boundary conditions on the inner and outer boundary of the semi-permeable zone with the aid of Mathematica symbolic software. Solutions for the drag force exerted by the couple stress fluid on the semi-permeable sphere and volumetric flow rate are also derived with corresponding expressions for the drag coefficient and non-dimensional volumetric flow rate. The influence of permeability (k), separation parameter (l), couple stress viscosity coefficient (η), couple stress inverse length dependent parameter (λ = √(μ/η)) and couple stress viscosity ratio (τ = η/η/) on all key variables is studied graphically. Additionally, streamline contours are computed for a range of parameters including inverse permeability parameter (α = 1/k). The computations show that increasing couple stress inverse length dependent parameter (λ) greatly reduces the dimensionless volumetric flow rate in particular at high values of separation parameter (l). Flow rate is, however, markedly enhanced with permeability (k) and also couple stress viscosity parameter (η). In the presence of the solid core, a much greater drag coefficient is observed at all values of couple stress inverse length dependent parameter (λ) relative to the case without a solid core. A significant distortion in streamlines is computed with increasing separation parameter (l) with a dual vortex structure emanating. With greater couple stress viscosity parameter (τ), no tangible modification is observed in the streamline contours. The present work generalizes the earlier study of Krishnan and Shukla to consider a semi-permeable (porous medium) outer sphere and furthermore presents detailed streamline visualizations of the creeping flow for a range of emerging parameters of relevance to non-Newtonian chemical engineering processes including emulsion droplet dynamics in porous materials. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",,Mathematics,John Wiley and Sons Inc,Article,Scopus

Cable vibration will react on the end-effector, causing attitude deviation of the end-effector. The main objective of this study is to accurately model axially moving flexible cables and characterize the dynamic behaviors of associated compliant CDPRs. Firstly, a model for transverse vibration of the axially moving length-variable cable is developed. On this basis, an original nonlinear dynamic model of the CDPRs able to capture the vibration of the cables and the dynamics of the end-effector is proposed. Secondly, the frequency-amplitude relationship of the CDPR is obtained. Moreover, the significance of the excitation effect caused by the axially moving length-variable cables is demonstrated, by comparing the results with and without excitation effect at different frequencies. It turns out that, as the oscillation frequency of the end-effector increases, the end-effector and cables exhibit the dynamics process from steady state to unstable large-amplitude vibration and finally to stable small-amplitude vibration. This indicates that the dynamics of the CDPR exhibit non-linear characteristics, due to the influence of flexible cables. Finally, the proposed dynamic model of compliant CDPRs is validated by experiments performed in the laboratory. © The Author(s), 2023.

Since data warehouses store and update enormous amounts of data from several sources, there is a potential that some of those references may contain inaccurate data. Due to the noise, inefficacy, and poor characterization of the vast amount of accessible data, as well as the ensuing insensitivity and inefficiencies of human data cleaning and labeling, the presentation of the data has become ambiguous, and the assessment of the information has become difficult. A hole in the creation of a better data analysis method was identified. This helped to guide the creation of a Python script for automatically cleaning and labeling data. The first step in the strategy used in this study to accomplish its goals and objectives was to obtain a financial dataset from the top database, ""Kaggle"". Create a machine learning (ML) approach in Python that intends to automate the financial dataset cleaning. This covers ingesting data, addressing incomplete data, addressing anomalies, one-hot wrapping and label encoding, extracting date and time values, and data normalization. Implementing an unsupervised machine learning method that attempts to automate financial dataset labeling (k-means). Using the method includes the elbow principle, k-means clustering, data modeling of ""age"" versus ""arrival,"" dimensionality reductions, computer vision, and dataset categorizing using the groupings. An empirical assessment of the cleaned and labeled automated trading dataset utilizing a comparison of the cleaned dataset before and after PCA adoption. The results show that the developed ML technique not only improved the performance of the audit data used in this study, but also classified the data after cleaning it and removing the unpleasant section and incomplete data, as shown by the k-means segmentation result and grouping by PCA. © 2023 Slovene Society Informatika.

The flow is driven by a constant axially applied electric field. The non-dimensional conservation equations with associated boundary conditions are solved with Gill's series expansion technique. The whole transport process is analyzed using three transport coefficients, namely, advection coefficient, dispersion coefficient and the apparent asymmetry coefficient, respectively. The mean concentration distribution of the solute is calculated via a third-order approximation of the series expansion. The study investigates the collective effects of yield stress and electric double layer (EDL) thickness (inverse Debye length) on the transport of solute. The long-term behaviour of mean concentration distribution is shown to be accurately predicted by second-order approximations; however, utilizing third or higher order approximations in Gill's series expansion enables a more refined analysis of the small and moderate time behavior of transport coefficients.

Due to having imerging applications in heat transfer, the nano-ferrofluids draw the attention which comprise an aqueous base fluid doped with a variety of magnetic nanoparticles, i.e. magnetite (Fe3O4), cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) and Manganese-zinc (Mn-Zn) ferrite. A partial differential equation mathematical model is developed for mass, momentum, magnetic field continuity (induction), and energy with appropriate wall and free stream boundary conditions. Following similarity transformations, the dimensionless resultant nonlinear ordinary differential boundary value problem is solved numerically using the robust bvp4c function in MATLAB which features very efficient 4th order optimized Runge–Kutta quadrature. Dual solutions for the upper branch and lower branch separated by a critical point are identified. Visualization of velocity, temperature, and induced magnetic field function are presented graphically including validation of solutions with previous studies. Furthermore, skin-friction coefficient and the local Nusselt number are also computed. The impact of the controlling parameters, i.e. Prandtl number (Formula presented.) nanoparticle volume fraction parameter (Formula presented.) reciprocal of magnetic Prandtl number (Formula presented.) magnetic parameter (Formula presented.) and stretching rate ratio parameter (Formula presented.) have been illustrated through graphs and evaluated when a desire heat transfer can occur. Furthermore, resistance between fluid and the plate can be increased with the growing magnetic Prandtl number values. Increment in magnetic parameter ((Formula presented.)) produces an elevation in the induced magnetic field magnitudes. Skin friction and Nusselt number are found to be greater for cobalt nanoparticles when compared to magnetite and Mn-Zn ferromagnetic nanoparticles when there is an increase in reciprocal magnetic Prandtl number.

However, because they cannot distinguish between foliage and other canopy elements, corrections are needed to determine leaf area index (LAI), which is typically the property of interest. In this study, we investigate near-infrared digital hemispherical photography (DHP) as a means of estimating and correcting for woody material. Using data collected at a deciduous broadleaf forest site, we show that near-infrared DHP could successfully estimate effective wood area index (WAIe) and wood area index (WAI) during leaf-on conditions, providing similar mean values (WAIe = 0.88, WAI = 1.53) to those determined from visible DHP during leaf-off conditions (WAIe = 0.87, WAI = 1.38). This information was used to correct estimates of effective PAI (PAIe) and PAI, enabling effective LAI (LAIe) and LAI to be derived with low RMSD (0.33 for LAIe and 0.76 for LAI), NRMSD (12% for LAIe and 19% for LAI), and bias (−0.01 for LAIe and −0.16 for LAI). Not correcting for woody material led to overestimation of LAIe by 31% on average and 46% in the worst observed case, and the degree of overestimation was further enlarged for LAI (42% on average and 61% in the worst observed case). In agreement with previous studies, the effects of clumping and woody area were found to be partly compensatory. On average, PAIe provided a reasonable approximation of LAI without correction, though overestimation of 52% and underestimation of 20% occurred at the lowest and highest LAI values, respectively. Compared to WAIe and WAI measurement using leaf-off visible DHP, near-infrared DHP offers two crucial advantages: i) data collection can be conducted at the same time as leaf-on PAIe and PAI measurements, and ii) it is likely that the approach could provide an indirect WAIe and WAI measurement option for evergreen species. © 2023 The Authors",DHP; Leaf area index (LAI); Near-infrared imagery; PAI; Wood area index (WAI),Mathematics,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

We disaggregate performance into its constituent components and find that driving, which tends to require power and speed, deteriorates consistently from the early 20s, whilst putting, which requires touch and finesse, remains strong until the late 40s.

A crucial challenge for developing a MIS robot is the kinematic design of the remote center-of-motion (RCM) mechanism. In this paper, a class of spatial RCM mechanism is analyzed. They are obtained by generating virtual parallelograms. The main process is to construct a line that passes through a fixed point under the mechanical constraint. The axis of the surgical tool is then constrained to parallel with that line. Hence, due to the geometrical feature of the parallel lines, the axis of the surgical tool will always pass through a fixed point, i.e., the RCM point. Due to the specially designed structure, the fixed point does not need to be physically belonging to the mechanism. The geometrical analysis method is employed to obtain the closed-form solution of the forward kinematics of the proposed mechanisms. Due to the high load capacity of parallel mechanism, the robots based on the proposed RCM mechanisms have promising applications as an external positioner to be used in robotic single-port surgeries.  © The Author(s), 2022.

These models provide the basis for perhaps more complicated models that can be used for prediction, experimentation, and explanation. First is the Poisson-match, for when goals are rare, or when goals are frequent but the restart after a goal is contested. Second is the binomial-match, for when goals are frequent and the restart uses the alternating rule. Third is the Markov-match, for when the restart uses the catch-up rule. We describe in detail the new model amongst these, the Markov-match, which is complementary to rather than competing with the binomial-match. The Markov-match is a bivariate generalisation of the Markov-binomial distribution. Its structure (catch-up restart) induces a larger correlation between the scores of competitors than does the binomial-match (alternating restart) but slightly more tied outcomes. The Markov-match is illustrated using handball, a high-scoring sport. In our analysis the time-varying strengths of 45 international handball teams are estimated. This poses some mathematical and computational problems, and in particular we describe how to shrink the strength-estimates of teams that play fewer games in tournaments because they are weaker. For the handball results, the Markov-match gives a better fit to data than the Poisson-match. © 2022 The Author(s)",Bivariate discrete distributions; OR in sports; Prediction; Selection bias; Shrinkage,Mathematics,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

In this study, bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) was utilized to capture sequential disability data, and federated learning was employed to enable training in the BFL-GO method. Also, gradient-based optimization was used to adjust the proposed BFL-GO method’s parameters during the process of hyperparameter tuning. In this work, the experiments were conducted on the Disability Statistics United States 2018 dataset.

A non-Darcy drag force model is deployed to capture both Darcy bulk drag and inertial Forchheimer (quadratic) drag effects. A diffusion flux model is deployed for radiative heat transfer. The Casson viscoplastic model has been utilized to simulate rheological characteristics. Due to polymeric slip effects, three slip phenomena are included at the wall (hydrodynamic, thermal and concentration) in the formulation. Furthermore, viscous dissipation and Ohmic heating (Joule dissipation) are also included. Robust scaling similarity variables are deployed to transform the governing partial differential equations into ordinary differential equations. Subsequently, the emerging dimensionless coupled nonlinear boundary value problem is solved utilizing the Bvp4c method in MATLAB version 2022. This numerical approach allows for a logical parametric examination of all key control parameters on the transport phenomena, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the system behavior. Validation with previous studies is included.

In addition, they affect the economic performance of the systems. In this study, PSS2B power system stabilizers and TCSC compensators are used to improve the stability margin of power systems. In order to coordinate TCSC compensators, the MOPSO multiobjective algorithm with integral of the time-weighted absolute error (ITAE) and figure of demerit (FD) objective functions was used. The MOPSO algorithm optimization results are compared with nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII) and multiobjective differential evolution (MODE) algorithms. The optimization results indicated a better performance of the proposed MOPSO algorithm than NSGAII and MODE. The simulations were iterated in two scenarios by creating different loading conditions in generators. The results indicated that the proposed control system, where the coordination between PSS2B power system stabilizers and TCSC compensators using the MOPSO algorithm, is better than power systems in which PSS2B Stabilizers or TCSC compensators are utilized solely. All criteria, e.g., ITAE, FD, maximum deviation range, and the required time for power oscillation damping in hybrid control systems, have been obtained. This means more stability and accurate and proper performance.  © 2022 Mehrdad Ahmadi Kamarposhti et al.",,Mathematics,Hindawi Limited,Article,Scopus

The classical methodology followed by drones is to return to their pre-assigned charging station every time it requires a station. This approach is found to be inefficient as it leads to an unnecessary waste of time as well as power, which could be easily saved if the drone is allotted a nearby charging station that is free. Therefore, we propose a drone-allocation model based on a preference matching algorithm where the drones will be allotted the nearest available station to land if the station is free. The problem is modeled as three entities: Drones, system controllers and charging stations. The matching algorithm was then used to design a Drone-Station Matching model. The simulation results of our proposed model showed that there would be considerably less power consumption and more time saving over the conventional system. This would save its travel time and power and ensure more efficient use of the drone.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",matching algorithm; resource allocation; smart city; stable matching; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV),Mathematics,World Scientific,Article,Scopus

By applying a pair of antagonistic MISAs to a joint, it is capable of achieving joint stiffness adjustment and joint torque adaptation. The joint with MISAs can achieve a wide range of joint stiffness, about 520% of that obtained by linear stiffness actuators, i.e. LSSA (share the same allowable elastic force and elastic travel with MISA). A stiffness range of 0-121.86 Nm and deflection of ± 8.9° can be achieved when MISAs are applied to a joint with a moment arm of 180 mm. The MISA achieves a high Power/Volume ratio of 345.02 × 103 W/m3. The application of the MISA in the development of a biomimetic robotic arm is also presented, with the investigation of joint stability and output torque analyse under various joint stiffnesses. Two experiments show that joints with MISAs can emulate the state of human joints when the muscles are tensed and relaxed. The dumbbell lifting test illustrates that the MISAs are capable of actuating the robot with desirable performance. © 2016 IEEE.",artificial muscle; compact soft actuator; MISA; variable joint stiffness,Mathematics,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Scopus

The impact of the Hartmann (magnetic) number, Debye–Hückel(electrokinetic) parameter, Darcy number, and chemical reaction parameter with regard to dispersion phenomena has been studied. The evolution in velocity and concentration profiles are investigated graphically for realistic ranges of the various physical parameters. The present investigation, highlights the dual nature of the Debye–Hückel parameter in the dispersion process. Increment in the lower or higher magnitudes of Debye–Hückel parameter induces or decreases the magnitudes of effective dispersion coefficient, whereas it induces a reverse dual mechanism in the zenith of the average concentration profile.

As typical examples, richly controllable behaviors of the self-similar soliton (SS), self-similar Akhmediev breather (SAB), self-similar Ma breather (SMB), and self-similar rogue wave (SRW) are presented in a periodic distribution nonlinear system. With the aid of a linear transformation, these novel similariton solutions are deployed as a basis for constructing two-component composite solutions to a pair of coherently coupled inNLS equations including four-wave mixing. The diverse composite waves that emerge, including SS–SS, SAB–SMB, and SRW–SRW families, are investigated in some detail.

Applying ML techniques like deep neural network (DNN) models has grown in popularity in recent years due to the complexity of healthcare data, which has been increasing. To extract hidden patterns and some other crucial information from the enormous amount of health data, which traditional analytics are unable to locate in a fair amount of time, ML approaches offer cost-effective and productive models for data analysis. We are encouraged to pursue this work because of the quick advancements made in DL approaches. The idea of DL is developing from its theoretical foundations to its applications. Modern ML models that are widely utilized in academia and industry, mostly in image classification and natural language processing, include DNN. Medical imaging technologies, medical healthcare data processing, medical disease diagnostics, and general healthcare all stand to greatly benefit from these developments. We have two goals: first, to conduct a survey on DL techniques for medical pictures, and second, to develop DL-based approaches for image classification. This paper is mainly targeted towards understanding the feasibility and different processes that could be adopted for medical image classification; for this, we perform a systematic literature review. A review of various existing techniques in terms of medical image classification indicates some shortcomings that have an impact on the performance of the whole model. This study aims to explore the existing DL approaches, challenges, brief comparisons, and applicability of different medical image processing are also studied and presented. The adoption of fewer datasets, poor use of temporal information, and reduced classification accuracy all contribute to the lower performance model, which is addressed.

Resource allocation and quality of service (QoS) optimization are critical challenges in MEC systems due to the large number of devices and applications involved. This results in poor latency with minimum throughput and energy consumption as well as a high delay rate. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach for resource allocation and QoS optimization in MEC using IoT by combining the hybrid kernel random Forest (HKRF) and ensemble support vector machine (ESVM) algorithms with crossover-based hunter–prey optimization (CHPO). The HKRF algorithm uses decision trees and kernel functions to capture the complex relationships between input features and output labels. The ESVM algorithm combines multiple SVM classifiers to improve the classification accuracy and robustness. The CHPO algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that mimics the hunting behavior of predators and prey in nature. The proposed approach aims to optimize the parameters of the HKRF and ESVM algorithms and allocate resources to different applications running on the MEC network to improve the QoS metrics such as latency, throughput, and energy efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms other algorithms in terms of QoS metrics and resource allocation efficiency. The throughput and the energy consumption attained by our proposed approach are 595 mbit/s and 9.4 mJ, respectively. © 2023 by the authors.",crossover-based hunter-prey optimization; ensemble support vector machine; hybrid kernel random forest; internet of things; quality of service; resource allocation,Mathematics,MDPI,Article,Scopus

The corresponding shear behavior and surface damage can be significantly affected by the roughness of the rock surfaces. In our study, sandstone with the same rough surface were prepared using rock engraving technology. The direct shear tests on the rough rock-CTB interfaces were carried out under four different normal stresses and six different roughness of the rock surfaces. The interfacial shear strength and corresponding surface damage were analyzed. A new shear strength criterion of the rough rock-CTB interface was then proposed and verified. Our study shows that the compressive deformation of the combined specimen is much larger than that of dilatancy under a higher normal stress. The residual shear strength is less affected by the rock surface roughness under lower normal stress. The corresponding shear strength of the rough rock-CTB interface does not necessarily increase with the rock surface roughness due to the large strength difference between the sandstone and CTB. The interfacial damaged zones, which increase with the normal stress, are roughly concentrated in the larger concave section of the corresponding 2D profiles. The established shear strength criterion of the rock-CTB interface consists of basic mechanical and morphology parameters which can be easily estimated by the general laboratory tests. The findings obtained from this study can be used to quantify the effect of the rough rock-CTB interface on the stability of CTB. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Cemented tailings backfill; Rock-CTB interface; Rough rock surface; Shear behavior; Surface damage,Mathematics,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

Besides capturing these data streams and reporting the monitoring information, there is significant potential for adopting deep learning to identify valuable insights for predictive preventive maintenance. One specific class of applications involves using Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) to predict faults happening in the near future. However, despite their remarkable performance, LSTMs can be very opaque. This paper deals with this issue by applying Learning Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (LFCMs) for developing simplified auxiliary models that can provide greater transparency. An LSTM model for predicting faults of industrial bearings based on readings from vibration sensors is developed to evaluate the idea. An LFCM is then used to imitate the performance of the baseline LSTM model. Through static and dynamic analyses, we demonstrate that LFCM can highlight (i) which members in a sequence of readings contribute to the prediction result and (ii) which values could be controlled to prevent possible faults. Moreover, we compare LFCM with state-of-the-art methods reported in the literature, including decision trees and SHAP values. The experiments show that LFCM offers some advantages over these methods. Moreover, LFCM, by conducting a what-if analysis, could provide more information about the black-box model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time LFCMs have been used to simplify a deep learning model to offer greater explainability. © 2023 The Authors.

This paper presents a unified framework for modeling and predicting discharge flow rate using an evolutionary-based polynomial regression technique. EPR (Evolutionary Polynomial Regression) is a data-driven method based on evolutionary computing to search for polynomial structures representing a system. The input parameters in the modeling procedure included the sheet pile height, upstream water head, and the hydraulic conductivity anisotropy ratio. Due to ever-increasing demand for water, a widely held view on predicting and controlling the available water behind reservoirs, dams, barrages, and weirs is of vital importance. To this end, the sheer novelty of the current study has been worn off through the development of a comprehensive model to predict the flow rate considering the most effective variables in the seepage issue. To the best of our knowledge, the research conducted in the literature has yet to cover the whole seepage problem using a comprehensive database extracted by numerical methods; thus, a comprehensive finite-element-based artificial database including 1000 data lines was created using the Scaled Boundary Finite Element Method (SBFEM) by simulating seepage beneath sheet plies covering a considerably wide range of seepage-related real-world values. The database was then employed to develop and validate the EPR flow rate prediction model. Data were divided into training (used for creating the models) and testing (for validating the developed models) data based on a statistical process. The procedure for preparing the data and developing and validating the models is presented in detail in this paper. The main advantage of the proposed models over a conventional and neural network and most GP (Genetic Programming)-based constitutive models is that they provide the optimum structure for the material constitutive model representation as well as its parameters, directly from raw experimental (or field) data. EPR can learn nonlinear and complex material behavior without any prior assumptions on the constitutive relationships. The proposed algorithm captures and transparently presents relationships between contributing parameters in polynomial expressions providing the user with a clear insight into the problem. EPR-based model predictions demonstrated an excellent agreement with the unseen simulated data used for validating the developed model. A parametric study on the presented models was conducted to investigate the effects of the contributing parameters on model predictions and the consistency of the parameter relationships with the database. Results of the parametric study showed that the effects of variations in the contributing parameters on EPR predictions are in line with the expected behavior. The merits and advantages of the proposed technique are discussed in the paper. © 2023, The Author(s).",Data mining; Evolutionary computation; Seepage flow rate; Sheet piles/cut-off walls,Mathematics,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Article,Scopus

Inspired by new developments in this field which require more sophisticated mathematical models, the current investigation examines the laminar viscoplastic boundary layer flow and mixed convective heat transfer over a power-law nonlinear stretching surface. To simulate thermal relaxation effects the hyperbolic Cattaneo-Christov heat flux model is deployed. The non-Newtonian polymer characteristics are described by employing the Casson flow model. High temperature conditions invoke thermal radiation flux which is analyzed with an algebraic flux model. Via robust similarity transformations, the primitive partial differential conservation equations for momentum and energy equations are rendered into a system of coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations with associated wall and free stream boundary conditions. The emerging boundary value problem is solved numerically with an efficient Chebyshev Spectral Newton Iterative scheme (CSNIS), in the MATLAB platform. The resulting solutions are discussed for different emerging parameters using graphs and tables. Validation is included with special cases from the literature. With increasing power law stretching index increases, the flow is decelerated, and temperatures are reduced. Increment in mixed convection parameter boosts the velocity but suppresses temperature and thermal boundary layer thickness. Increasing non-Fourier Deborah number, temperatures are depleted whereas with increasing radiative flux parameter they are increased. With elevation in Casson non-Newtonian parameter, velocity is decreased whereas temperature is enhanced and Nusselt number is suppressed. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",,Mathematics,John Wiley and Sons Inc,Article,Scopus

There are some studies on generating discriminative features where feature fusion and attention are applied to enhance targets. However, the saliency information and information interaction which assist in locating the targets is ignored. To improve the accuracy of infrared ship target tracking, we propose a saliency guided Siamese attention network (SGSiamAttn). The main contribution is to design a saliency prediction network that obtains the saliency map of a search region and followed by a saliency enhancement network to highlight the target. With the saliency information, our network is able to perceive the entire target, which improves the discriminative ability and the tracking accuracy. Meanwhile, a local-to-global correlation module is applied before the saliency prediction network, aiming to refine the correlation map while suppressing non-target interferences. We also impose a shared cross-correlation module on the region proposal network. By sharing the correlation map in the classification and regression branches, it enhances information interaction between the two tasks and reduces the computational cost. As there are limited number of infrared ship tracking datasets publicly available, we construct a new infrared ship dataset (ISD) which includes 16 different types of ships and 7,872 video frames with manual annotations. The experimental results on ISD and other three public datasets, namely VOT-TIR2015, PTB-TIR, and LSOTB-TIR, demonstrate that our tracker achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy, expected average overlap, success, and precision.

The greatest risk from melanoma is its ability to broadly spread throughout the body by means of lymphatic vessels and veins. Thus, the early diagnosis of melanoma is a key factor in improving the prognosis of the disease. Deep learning makes it possible to design and develop intelligent systems that can be used in detecting and classifying skin lesions from visible-light images. Such systems can provide early and accurate diagnoses of melanoma and other types of skin diseases. This paper proposes a new method which can be used for both skin lesion segmentation and classification problems. This solution makes use of Convolutional neural networks (CNN) with the architecture two-dimensional (Conv2D) using three phases: feature extraction, classification and detection. The proposed method is mainly designed for skin cancer detection and diagnosis. Using the public dataset International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), the impact of the proposed segmentation method on the performance of the classification accuracy was investigated. The obtained results showed that the proposed skin cancer detection and classification method had a good performance with an accuracy of 94%, sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 96%. Also comparing with the related work using the same dataset, i.e., ISIC, showed a better performance of the proposed method. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

They have been used in several modern data transmission standards, where the codecs are often built inside specialized integrated circuits (ICs). On the other hand, Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) circuits have evolved as a critical design characteristic that the designer must consider such as power, which has been overlooked by many researchers. For that reason, in this paper, a research work that reduces LDPC encoder power consumption is presented using a well-known power reduction method named Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), which is one of the most powerful power reduction strategies in CMOS circuits. The proposed system includes a fuzzy logic controller with the DVFS technique to control and select the optimum level of voltage that enters the encoder to reduce its total power consumption. This combination of these two techniques showed significant power reduction and control while causing no impact on the LDPC efficiency, flexibility, and performance.

A novel mode transition mechanism controls self-holding electromagnets for switching modes between the four-bar linkage and single-axis structure. Compared with the conventional single-axis hybrid knee, the four-bar polycentric mechanism with varying instantaneous center of rotation (ICR) can enhance the geometric stability and increase the toe clearance in passive mode. For active mode, we developed a custom embedded electric system, employed torque control for stance and position control for swing. The results of bench tests indicated that the bandwidth of the controller was suitable for locomotion.

By analyzing the COVID-19 chest X-ray images, a novel metaheuristic approach is proposed based on hybrid dipper throated and particle swarm optimizers. The lung region was segmented from the original chest X-ray images and augmented using various transformation operations. Furthermore, the augmented images were fed into the VGG19 deep network for feature extraction. On the other hand, a feature selection method is proposed to select the most significant features that can boost the classification results. Finally, the selected features were input into an optimized neural network for detection. The neural network is optimized using the proposed hybrid optimizer. The experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved 99.88% accuracy, outperforming the existing COVID-19 detection models.

Nevertheless, machine learning models are vulnerable and are exposed to different security and privacy attacks. Hence, these issues should be addressed while using ML models to preserve the security and privacy of the data used. There is a need to secure ML models, especially in the training phase to preserve the privacy of the training datasets and to minimise the information leakage. In this paper, we present an overview of ML threats and vulnerabilities, and we highlight current progress in the research works proposing defence techniques against ML security and privacy attacks. The relevant background for the different attacks occurring in both the training and testing/inferring phases is introduced before presenting a detailed overview of Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) and the related countermeasures. In this paper, we introduce a countermeasure against membership inference attacks (MIA) on Conventional Neural Networks (CNN) based on dropout and L2 regularization. Through experimental analysis, we demonstrate that this defence technique can mitigate the risks of MIA attacks while ensuring an acceptable accuracy of the model. Indeed, using CNN model training on two datasets CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we empirically verify the ability of our defence strategy to decrease the impact of MIA on our model and we compare results of five different classifiers. Moreover, we present a solution to achieve a trade-off between the performance of the model and the mitigation of MIA attack. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

We developed a computationally efficient model combining optimization and inverse dynamics to predict three-dimensional whole-body motions and forces during human walking without relying on measurement data. Using the model, we explored two different optimization objectives, mechanical energy expenditure and the time integral of normalized joint torque. Of the two criteria, the sum of the time integrals of the normalized joint torques produced a more realistic walking gait. The reason for this difference is that most of the mechanical energy expenditure is in the sagittal plane (based on measurement data) and this leads to difficulty in prediction in the other two planes. We conclude that mechanical energy may only account for part of the complex performance criteria driving human walking in three dimensions. © 2022, The Author(s).",Inverse dynamics; Locomotion; Optimization; Predictive models; Three-dimensional,Mathematics,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Article,Scopus

This pathway mediates the transfer of one-carbon units, playing a crucial role in nucleotide synthesis, methylation, and amino acid homeostasis. The folinic acid futile cycle adds a layer of intrigue to this pathway, due to its associations with metabolism, cell growth, and dormancy. It also introduces additional complexity to folate metabolism. A logical way to deal with such complexity is to examine it by using mathematical modelling. This work describes the construction and analysis of a model of folate metabolism, which includes the folinic acid futile cycle. This model was tested under three in silico growth conditions. Model simulations revealed: 1) the folate cycle behaved as a stable biochemical system in three growth states (slow, standard, and rapid); 2) the initial concentration of serine had the greatest impact on metabolite concentrations; 3) 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cyclo-ligase (5-FCL) activity had a significant impact on the levels of the 7 products that carry the one-carbon donated from folates, and the redox couple NADP/NADPH; this was particularly evident in the rapid growth state; 4) 5-FCL may be vital to the survival of the cells by maintaining low levels of homocysteine, as high levels can induce toxicity; and 5) the antifolate therapeutic trimethoprim had a greater impact on folate metabolism with higher nutrient availability. These results highlight the important role of 5-FCL in intracellular folate homeostasis and mass generation under different metabolic scenarios. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Bacteria; Cell dormancy; Cell growth; Folinic acid; Futile cycle; Mathematical model,,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,Article,Scopus

Inspired by the emergence of tri-hybrid magnetic nanofluids which utilize three distinct nanoparticles in a single base fluid coating, the present article examines analytically and computationally the swirl coating of magnetic ternary hybrid nanofluid from a rotating disk, as a simulation of spin coating deposition processes in materials manufacturing. Owing to high temperature fabrication conditions, thermal radiative heat transfer is also considered and a Rossleand flux model deployed. (Formula presented.) - (Formula presented.) - (Formula presented.) hybrid nanoparticles are considered with Ethylene Glycol-Water ((Formula presented.)) base fluid. A filtration medium is also featured (porous medium) adjacent to the disk and the Darcy-Forchheimer model is deployed to simulate both bulk matrix porous drag encountered at lower Reynolds numbers and inertial quadratic drag generated at higher Reynolds numbers. Thermal relaxation of the coating nanofluid is additionally addressed and a non-Fourier Cattaneo-Christov model is therefore implemented in the heat conservation equation. Viscous dissipation is also included in the model. The governing conservation equations for mass, momenta (radial, tangential and axial) and energy with prescribed boundary conditions are rendered into coupled nonlinear ordinary differential boundary layer equations via suitable scaling variables and the Von Karman transformations. The derived reduced boundary value problem is then solved with a Runge-Kutta numerical scheme and shooting scheme in MATLAB. Validation of solutions is included with previous studies. Radial and azimuthal velocities, temperature, radial skin-friction, azimuthal skin friction and local Nusselt number are computed for a range of selected parameters. A comparative assessment of mono nanofluid (Formula presented.) Hybrid (Formula presented.) - (Formula presented.) nanofluid and tri-Hybrid (Formula presented.) - (Formula presented.) - (Formula presented.) nanofluid is conducted. This combination of hybrid nanoparticles has never been examined previously in the literature and constitutes the significant novelty of the present work.

However, few studies concentrated a complete simulation of the whole forearm complex including ligaments. This paper aims to investigate the load transmission through the bones, contact stress at the joints and strain in the ligaments by using an elaborate FE model, further validating the fracture condition for human forearm. The interosseous ligament was separated into three regions based on the distance to the proximal and distal ends. The FE simulation results were slightly more or less than a previous experimental data in the literature, but generally provided a close approximation of the bone and ligament behaviors. Compared with the experiment results under different loading conditions, maximum contact stress at the proximal radio ulnar joint (PRUJ) and distal radio ulnar joint (DRUJ) of the simulations was higher with an average of 13.4%, and peak strain in the interosseous ligament (IOL) was lower with an average of 11.0%. Under 10 kg load, the maximum stress in the radius (2.25 MPa) was less than double the value in the ulna (1.43 MPa). Finally, the FE model has been validated with the onset and location of the Colles' fracture in the literature. This study will provide a great benefit in terms of surgical and medical applications related to forearm fracture that require an extensive knowledge of the behavior of the bones and ligaments under various loading conditions. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",biomechanics; finite element analysis; human forearm fracture; interosseous ligament,,John Wiley and Sons Inc,Article,Scopus

The unit-less eigenvalue problem is constructed through linear and nonlinear stability assumptions and which is solved numerically using a fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme. The critical values of wave and thermal Rayleigh parameters are evaluated. Extended graphical and tabular visualization is presented to describe the onset of the convection mechanism. The results of this semi-numerical investigation may be useful in environmental, geothermal and chemical engineering processes. In addition, the critical (Formula presented.) value is also determined for a range of thermo-physical numbers. Significant modifications in the flow patterns are computed with mass flow parameter and vertical thermal and solutal Rayleigh number. With an increment in Soret (thermo-diffusive) parameter (Formula presented.) the regime become more unstable.

But the time and cost of this algorithm are high. Using asexual reproduction optimization (ARO) algorithm, the authors achieved better results in less time. So the authors achieved less cost in a shorter time. Their framework addressed the problems such as high costs and training time in credit card fraud detection. This simple and effective approach has achieved better results than the best techniques implemented on our dataset so far. The purpose of this paper is to detect credit card fraud using ARO. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors used ARO algorithm to classify the bank transactions into fraud and legitimate. ARO is taken from asexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction refers to a kind of production in which one parent produces offspring identical to herself. In ARO algorithm, an individual is shown by a vector of variables. Each variable is considered as a chromosome. A binary string represents a chromosome consisted of genes. It is supposed that every generated answer exists in the environment, and because of limited resources, only the best solution can remain alive. The algorithm starts with a random individual in the answer scope. This parent reproduces the offspring named bud. Either the parent or the offspring can survive. In this competition, the one which outperforms in fitness function remains alive. If the offspring has suitable performance, it will be the next parent, and the current parent becomes obsolete. Otherwise, the offspring perishes, and the present parent survives. The algorithm recurs until the stop condition occurs. Findings: Results showed that ARO had increased the AUC (i.e. area under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve), sensitivity, precision, specificity and accuracy by 13%, 25%, 56%, 3% and 3%, in comparison with AIS, respectively. The authors achieved a high precision value indicating that if ARO detects a record as a fraud, with a high probability, it is a fraud one. Supporting a real-time fraud detection system is another vital issue. ARO outperforms AIS not only in the mentioned criteria, but also decreases the training time by 75% in comparison with the AIS, which is a significant figure. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors implemented the ARO in credit card fraud detection. The authors compared the results with those of the AIS, which was one of the best methods ever implemented on the benchmark dataset. The chief focus of the fraud detection studies is finding the algorithms that can detect legal transactions from the fraudulent ones with high detection accuracy in the shortest time and at a low cost. That ARO meets all these demands. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Artificial immune systems; Asexual reproduction optimization; Credit card fraud detection; Fraud detection; Machine learning,,Emerald Publishing,Article,Scopus

Eringen's micropolar model is deployed for non-Newtonian characteristics and the Buongiorno nanofluid model employed for nanoscale effects (thermophoresis and Brownian motion). The model includes double stratification (thermal and solutal) and also chemical reaction effects, heat source, and viscous dissipation. Darcy's model is employed for the porous medium and a Rosseland diffusion flux approximation for nonlinear thermal radiation. The nonlinear governing partial differential conservation equations are rendered into nonlinear ordinary differential equations via relevant transformations. An innovative semi-numerical methodology combining the Adomian decomposition method (ADM) with Padé approximants and known as ADM-Padé is deployed to solve the emerging nonlinear ordinary differential boundary value problem with appropriate wall and free stream conditions in MATLAB software. A detailed parametric study of the influence of key parameters on stream function, velocity, microrotation (angular velocity), temperature, and nanoparticle concentration profiles is conducted. Furthermore, skin friction coefficient, wall couple stress coefficient, Nusselt number, and Sherwood number are displayed in tables. The validation of both numerical techniques used, i.e., ADM and ADM-Padé, against a conventional numerical 4th order Runge-Kutta method is also included and significant acceleration in convergence of solutions achieved with the ADM-Padé approach. The flow is decelerated with greater buoyancy ratio parameter whereas microrotation (angular velocity) is enhanced. Increasing thermal and solutal stratification suppresses microrotation. Concentration magnitudes are boosted with greater chemical reaction parameter and Lewis number. Temperatures are significantly enhanced with radiative parameter. Increasing Brownian motion parameter depletes concentration values.

In the past twenty years, the volume of digitised wildlife sound available has massively increased, and automatic classification through deep learning now shows strong results. However, bioacoustics is not a single task but a vast range of small-scale tasks (such as individual ID, call type, emotional indication) with wide variety in data characteristics, and most bioacoustic tasks do not come with strongly-labelled training data. The standard paradigm of supervised learning, focussed on a single large-scale dataset and/or a generic pre-trained algorithm, is insufficient. In this work we recast bioacoustic sound event detection within the AI framework of few-shot learning. We adapt this framework to sound event detection, such that a system can be given the annotated start/end times of as few as 5 events, and can then detect events in long-duration audio—even when the sound category was not known at the time of algorithm training. We introduce a collection of open datasets designed to strongly test a system's ability to perform few-shot sound event detections, and we present the results of a public contest to address the task. Our analysis shows that prototypical networks are a very common used strategy and they perform well when enhanced with adaptations for general characteristics of animal sounds. However, systems with high time resolution capabilities perform the best in this challenge. We demonstrate that widely-varying sound event durations are an important factor in performance, as well as non-stationarity, i.e. gradual changes in conditions throughout the duration of a recording. For fine-grained bioacoustic recognition tasks without massive annotated training data, our analysis demonstrate that few-shot sound event detection is a powerful new method, strongly outperforming traditional signal-processing detection methods in the fully automated scenario. © 2023 The Authors",Bioacoustics; Deep learning; Event detection; Few-shot learning,,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

It is found that there exist three types of MI spectra with distinct characteristics termed baseband, passband, and zero-baseband based on the instability analysis of the in-phase and out-of-phase CW solutions. The coherent coupling nonlinearity is the source of the passband and zero-baseband variants. Guided by analytical predictions, we investigate numerically the excitation of rogue waves on weakly perturbed in-phase and out-of-phase continuous wave solutions in the parameter space where different kinds of MI exist. Simulations provide supporting evidence that rogue waves can only emerge in regimes where baseband or zero-baseband MI occurs. Moreover, the peak intensity of rogue waves in the case of baseband MI is greater than in the zero-baseband case. Finally, a combination of analysis and numerics uncovers the parameter conditions necessary for the generation of rogue waves. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Coherent coupling nonlinearity; Modulation instability; Nonlinear Schrödinger equations; Rogue wave,,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

To overcome these weaknesses, a novel prosthetic ankle based on hydraulics is described here. The ankle joint drives two cams, which in turn drive two hydraulic rams. One cam-ram system captures the negative work done from foot-flat until maximum dorsiflexion, by pumping oil into an accumulator, while the other returns positive work during push-off providing forward propulsion through fluid flowing from the accumulator to the ram. Simulation results are promising: of the total negative work done by the prosthetic ankle over the gait cycle (i.e., the maximum amount of energy available to be stored), 78% is returned, mainly during push-off; 14% is carried forward for future gait cycles; and 8% is lost. The estimated prosthesis height and mass are approximately {26}.{5} {cm} and {2}.{3} {kg}. Nonetheless, further work is necessary to realise a prototype for bench and in-vivo testing. By mimicking intact ankle torque and efficiently storing and returning energy at the ankle joint, this new design may contribute to reducing amputees' metabolic cost of walking. © 2018 IEEE.",Ankle; cam; hydraulics; prosthetics; simulation,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Scopus
