A common catchphrase today, big data is an all-encompassing concept that refers to the ability to analyze huge quantities of information and make valuable conclusions that otherwise could not be revealed using smaller data and traditional methods. The book is approachable from the onset and maintains reader interest while espousing the scientific, societal, and economic potential of big data."

                – The purpose of this paper is to identify and describe the most prominent research areas connected with “Big Data” and propose a thorough definition of the term. 
            
            
               Design/methodology/approach
                – The authors have analysed a conspicuous corpus of industry and academia articles linked with Big Data to find commonalities among the topics they treated. The authors have also compiled a survey of existing definitions with a view of generating a more solid one that encompasses most of the work happening in the field. 
            
            
               Findings
                – The main themes of Big Data are: information, technology, methods and impact. The authors propose a new definition for the term that reads as follows: “Big Data is the Information asset characterized by such a High Volume, Velocity and Variety to require specific Technology and Analytical Methods for its transformation into Value.” 
            
            
               Practical implications
                – The formal definition that is proposed can enable a more coherent development of the concept of Big Data, as it solely relies on the essential strands of current state-of-the-art and is coherent with the most popular definitions currently used. 
            
            
               Originality/value
                – This is among the first structured attempts of building a convincing definition of Big Data. It also contains an original exploration of the topic in connection with library management."

The rise of different big data frameworks such as Apache Hadoop and, more recently, Spark, for massive data processing based on the MapReduce paradigm has allowed for the efficient utilisation of data mining methods and machine learning algorithms in different domains. A number of libraries such as Mahout and SparkMLib have been designed to develop new efficient applications based on machine learning algorithms. The combination of big data technologies and traditional machine learning algorithms has generated new and interesting challenges in other areas as social media and social networks. These new challenges are focused mainly on problems such as data processing, data storage, data representation, and how data can be used for pattern mining, analysing user behaviours, and visualizing and tracking data, among others. In this paper, we present a revision of the new methodologies that is designed to allow for efficient data mining and information fusion from social media and of the new applications and frameworks that are currently appearing under the ""umbrella"" of the social networks, social media and big data paradigms. (D. Camacho). petabytes (and even exabytes) in size, and the massive sizes of these datasets extend beyond the ability of average database software tools to capture, store, manage, and analyse them effectively.The concept of big data has been defined through the 3V model, which was defined in 2001 by Laney [5] as: ""high-volume, highvelocity and high-variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing for enhanced insight and decision making"". More recently, in 2012, Gartner [6] updated the definition as follows: ""Big data is high volume, high velocity, and/or high variety information assets that require new forms of processing to enable enhanced decision making, insight discovery and process optimization"". Both definitions refer to the three basic features of big data: Volume, Variety, and Velocity. Other organisations, and big data practitioners (e.g., researchers, engineers, and so on), have extended this 3V model to a 4V model by including a new ""V"": Value [7]. This model can be even extended to 5Vs if the concepts of Veracity is incorporated into the big data definition.Summarising, this set of * V-models provides a straightforward and widely accepted definition related to what is (and what is not) a big-data-based problem, application, software, or framework. These concepts can be briefly described as follows [5,7]:• Volume: refers to large amounts of any kind of data from any different sources, including mobile digital data creation devices and digital devices.

Big Data,3,2020,Frontiers Media SA,,,"Starting from an analysis of frequently employed definitions of big data, it will be argued that, to overcome the intrinsic weaknesses of big data, it is more appropriate to define the object in relational terms. The excessive emphasis on volume and technological aspects of big data, derived from their current definitions, combined with neglected epistemological issues gave birth to an objectivistic rhetoric surrounding big data as implicitly neutral, omni-comprehensive, and theory-free. This rhetoric contradicts the empirical reality that embraces big data: (1) data collection is not neutral nor objective; (2) exhaustivity is a mathematical limit; and (3) interpretation and knowledge production remain both theoretically informed and subjective. Addressing these issues, big data will be interpreted as a methodological revolution carried over by evolutionary processes in technology and epistemology. By distinguishing between forms of nominal and actual access, we claim that big data promoted a new digital divide changing stakeholders, gatekeepers, and the basic rules of knowledge discovery by radically shaping the power dynamics involved in the processes of production and analysis of data."

Consequently, advances in data science methods will expand the knowledge for testing new hypotheses about biomechanical risk factors associated with walking and running gait-related musculoskeletal injury. This paper begins with a brief introduction to an automated three-dimensional (3D) biomechanical gait data collection system: 3D GAIT, followed by how the studies in the field of gait biomechanics fit the quantities in the 5 V’s definition of big data: volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value. Next, we provide a review of recent research and development in multivariate and machine learning methods-based gait analysis that can be applied to big data analytics. These modern biomechanical gait analysis methods include several main modules such as initial input features, dimensionality reduction (feature selection and extraction), and learning algorithms (classification and clustering). Finally, a promising big data exploration tool called “topological data analysis” and directions for future research are outlined and discussed."

The term big data was coined to capture the meaning of this emerging trend. In addition to its sheer volume, big data also exhibits other unique characteristics as compared with traditional data. For instance, big data is commonly unstructured and require more real-time analysis. This development calls for new system architectures for data acquisition, transmission, storage, and large-scale data processing mechanisms. In this paper, we present a literature survey and system tutorial for big data analytics platforms, aiming to provide an overall picture for nonexpert readers and instill a do-it-yourself spirit for advanced audiences to customize their own big-data solutions. First, we present the definition of big data and discuss big data challenges. Next, we present a systematic framework to decompose big data systems into four sequential modules, namely data generation, data acquisition, data storage, and data analytics. These four modules form a big data value chain. Following that, we present a detailed survey of numerous approaches and mechanisms from research and industry communities. In addition, we present the prevalent Hadoop framework for addressing big data challenges. Finally, we outline several evaluation benchmarks and potential research directions for big data systems.

In order to fully utilize the potential of Industrial Big Data we need data-driven techniques that operate at scales that process models cannot. Here we present a prototype technique for data-driven anomaly detection to operate at industrial scale. The method generalizes to application with almost any multivariate dataset based on independent ordinations of repeated (bootstrapped) partitions of the dataset and inspection of the joint distribution of ordinal distances. a"
