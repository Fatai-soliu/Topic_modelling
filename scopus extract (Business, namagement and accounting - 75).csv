Hassanein A.; Kokel A.,Corporate cash hoarding and corporate governance mechanisms: evidence from Borsa Istanbul,Asia-Pacific Journal of Accounting and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066026037&doi=10.1080%2f16081625.2019.1617753&partnerID=40&md5=6d4d314ad2086aab956d62fec61507e7,"Hoarding cash can create conflicts of interest between managers and shareholders that lead to an agency conflict. Corporate governance is a mechanism to overcome agency conflicts. Thus, this study aims to examine the effect of corporate governance mechanisms on the corporate decision to hoard cash. The study focuses on the BIST100 nonfinancial firms listed on the Borsa Istanbul during the period from 2010 to 2014. It finds that firms with smaller boards of directors and larger audit committees are likely to hoard less cash. However, firms with a large percentage of independent directors are likely to hoard more cash. This study also finds that when the CEO of a firm acts as the chairman of the board, the firm tends to hoard more cash. Further, the study finds that firms audited by a big auditor are more likely to hoard less cash than firms audited by a non-big auditor. These results suggest that firms with good corporate governance mechanisms (except for the percentage of independent directors) are likely to hoard less cash to reduce agency conflicts. © 2019 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.",Corporate cash hoarding; corporate governance; Turkey,Business and management,Routledge,Article,Scopus
Baroun A.E.,"Meritocracy, personality traits and recruitment: some insights from the Qatari enterprising community",Journal of Enterprising Communities,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101455062&doi=10.1108%2fJEC-12-2020-0216&partnerID=40&md5=6f2d9098a325759e78bad1703a0b884b,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a picture on the impact of the meritocracy and personality traits on the recruitment process in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the State of Qatar. Design/methodology/approach: The study used ADANCO software for carrying a structural equation modelling analysis and for descriptive statistics. Findings: The findings showed that meritocracy and personality traits had an impact on recruitment process. In addition, meritocracy showed to be more important than personality traits in the recruitment process. Research limitations/implications: This research is conducted only in one country, i.e. the State of Qatar, and findings cannot be generalised for other countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council and abroad. Extending this research in other countries and comparing the findings will help create a better portray on the role of meritocracy and personality traits on the recruitment process. Practical implications: This paper will help the Qatari and other SMEs owners to use a more comprehensive approach during the recruitment of their employees, considering that the process of recruitment plays an important role within the overall human resource management. Recruiting the right people has become an extremely daunting mission for SMEs, given that competition for talent is increasingly becoming a very tough and uncompromising issue. Originality/value: To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the only paper that has researched the role of meritocracy and personality traits on the recruitment process in the SMEs in the State of Qatar and abroad. Separate studies were conducted that treat the impact of meritocracy and personality on recruiting the right person(s) for the company, but none treated these aspects together in one single paper. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Employees; Meritocracy; Personality; Qatar; Recruitment; SMEs,Business and management,Emerald Publishing,Article,Scopus

It includes components that repeatedly apply different classification methods on data sets and measures their performance. The characteristics of the data sets, combined with the algorithms and the performance provide the training examples. A decision tree algorithm is applied to the training examples to induce the knowledge, which can then be used to recommend algorithms for new data sets. The paper makes a contribution to both meta-learning and cost-sensitive machine learning approaches. Those both fields are not new, however, building a recommender that recommends the optimal case-sensitive approach for a given data problem is the contribution. The proposed solution is implemented in WEKA and evaluated by applying it on different data sets and comparing the results with existing studies available in the literature. The results show that a developed meta-learning solution produces better results than METAL, a well-known meta-learning system. The developed solution takes the misclassification cost into consideration during the learning process, which is not available in the compared project.

This paper examines the short-term effects of Covid-19 on the British credit union sector drawing on survey data for 58 credit unions and follow-up interviews with 21 credit union managers. Loan demand, and the volume and value of loans were significantly lower in March and April 2020 after the introduction of government restrictions than in March and April 2019. Bad debt provisioning was also significantly higher in April 2020 than in April 2019. There was no significant difference for loan interest income between April 2019 and April 2020. The findings suggest that credit unions were affected by the pandemic in the same way as other financial institutions. For the majority of the credit unions, the decline in lending may be explained by a drop in consumer demand rather than restrictions put on the supply of credit. It is too early to conclude if the adverse economic conditions caused by Covid-19 will negatively affect the sustainability and ability of the sector to generate surpluses or if the cooperative model will shield the sector from resulting economic fluctuations, as suggested by the literature. © 2023 The Authors",Cooperatives; Covid-19; Credit unions; Economic crises; Government restrictions; Lending,Business and management,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Scopus

But how does working with high BLM supervisors affect employees’ functioning both at work and at home? Guided by this question, we draw on social information processing theory and insights from the person–environment fit literature for a nuanced understanding of the effects of supervisor BLM. Using data from two field studies conducted in China (340 employees) and the United States (174 employees), we find that supervisor BLM increases employee perceptions of a competitive climate that ultimately increases employee thriving at work and insomnia outside work. We further find that employee trait competitiveness moderated the indirect relationship (via perceived competitive climate) between supervisor BLM and thriving at work but not for insomnia; employees high (versus low) in trait competitiveness were found to thrive at work under the competitive climate stimulated by high BLM supervisors. Taken together, our findings highlight the need for organizational leaders to be cautious of being too narrowly focused on bottom-line outcomes and aware of the wider implications of BLM on different domains of their employees’ lives. © The Author(s) 2020.",insomnia; perceived competitive climate; supervisor bottom-line mentality; thriving at work; trait competitiveness,Business and management,SAGE Publications Ltd,Article,Scopus

Although the potential of VR is to increase the effectiveness and productivity of the project phases from initial concept design to detailed design preparation. VR adoption in the United Kingdom (UK) Architectural Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector is slow compared to other sectors. This research focuses on ascertaining the drivers and barriers of VR in construction projects in the UK. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts an online survey design. It uses Bristol Online Survey (BOS) to create a structured questionnaire that is used to assess UK construction professionals using a convenience sampling technique. Therefore, researcher uses descriptive and inferential technique for data analysis and presentation based on Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) to analyze the questionnaire. Findings: The research findings revealed the most significant barriers to VR adoption in UK construction industry were lack of skills/expertise and cultural change. Hence, the main drivers of VR adoption as rated by the professionals in the UK construction industry are improved safety, improved quality and improved productivity. Practical implications: The identification and assessment of the drivers and barriers to VR adoption could advance VR adoption among construction professionals and other stakeholders of the UK AEC sector. This could also be extended to developing countries, given the status of VR as being in the developing stage. Originality/value: This study provides valuable insights to construction professionals and stakeholders to plan actions that could enhance the drivers and mitigate the barriers of VR. This study's main contribution is to group and classify various drivers and barriers into easily understood categories, in order to potentiate the drivers and reduce the barriers effectively. The groupings could be used as benchmarks in similar studies in developing countries. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",AEC industry; Barriers; Drivers; United Kingdom; Virtual reality adoption,Business and management,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,Article,Scopus

Critical areas that need to adapt to the change are inter-organizational buyer-supplier relationships managed by Purchasing and Supply Management (PSM) professionals. That is, their future responsibilities and skills are likely to change. Introducing the concept of specialized roles to summarize needed competencies, this research conducted a real-time Delphi study using an internet-based platform involving 47 procurement experts. As a result, the roles of the Data Analyst, Master Data Manager, Process Automation Manager, Supplier Onboarding Manager, System Innovation Scout, and Legislation Specialist were identified as essential Industry 4.0 PSM roles. For these roles, the probability of their occurrence, industry impact, desirability, and level of industry adoption are assessed. Based on emerging technologies in PSM and adopting a human-centered perspective, this research shows the need to focus on talent development to enable a technology-driven revolution. Thus, the contributions lay in the literature on Industry 4.0 and the PSM skills and capabilities domain, highlighting the required roles for Smart Working and effective Smart Supply Chains management as parts of the digital transformation journey. © 2023 The Authors",Competencies; Forecasting; Industry 4.0; Purchasing and supply management; Roles; Smart working,Business and management,Elsevier Inc.,Article,Scopus

It optimises the land in effective ways to accommodate urban growth in specific urban areas to ensure a sustainable urban environment. The argued advantages include urban sprawl control, urban land utilisation, reduction of land development cost, and the creation of compacted neighbourhoods. METHODS: Based on a critical literature review, the paper examines the upgrading process of three informal settlements using a qualitative logical framework related to land location, property markets and development codes; such a logical framework can enhance the main urban factors that impact the upgrading process in developing cities. Most urban intensification platforms in developing countries neglect the role of the property market in the utilisation that financial resources can mediate the land and development resources available for redevelopment. RESULTS: Urban expansion includes targeted slum dwellings through vertical expansion where there is no available greenfield land, and horizontal expansion in terms of available greenfield land; the development process must ensure accessible public amenities and pedestrian-friendly residential settlements. The property market platform must introduce housing finance that works for the urban poor and informal workers through fair interest rates, mortgage terms and down payment rates. They must create an appropriate partnership between private, public, and slum dweller sectors to ensure the accessibility of urban poor to redevelopment settlements while approaching inclusive development outcomes. It should take appropriate allocation of land value capture to ensure cost-efficient development processes into consideration. The planning and redevelopment process must ensure an appropriate land development code that makes use of available labour and worker skills in the construction process while utilising the housing area to ensure affordable housing units. There should also be a land readjustment plan that would allow liveable and well compacted residential settlements. CONCLUSIONS: Developing cities face challenges of rising informal settlements. Many upgrading schemes have resulted in overpriced housing units, lack of public amenities and exclusion development schemes. Such outcomes have impacted the accessibility of slum dwellers to the slum redevelopment projects, causing many to lose their economic and social networks due to relocation, while the beneficiary groups lack access to decent public services. These situations require urban intensification that would utilise financial, human and land resources. Because of this, many lessons have been learned; specifically, that land value capture, housing financial markets, urban expansion and development codes can be driven by the three case studies of Kibera, Lideta and Dharavi to ensure a better quality of residential settlements. © 2022 World Journal of Science, Technology and Sustainable Development (WJSTSD).",Land Readjustment; Property Market; Slum Upgrading; Urban Intensification,Business and management,World Association for Sustainable Development,Article,Scopus
Alkaraan F.; Albahloul M.; Hussainey K.,"Carillion's strategic choices and the boardroom's strategies of persuasive appeals: ethos, logos and pathos",Journal of Applied Accounting Research,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144901827&doi=10.1108%2fJAAR-06-2022-0134&partnerID=40&md5=095a9dba671caa978fc89f9d9f76740d,"Purpose: Companies documents such as annual reports incorporate narratives of repetitive rhetorical strategies as effective mechanisms adopted by companies' boardrooms to promote strategic change and strategic choices. These mechanisms can be viewed as persuasive appeals to facilitate boardrooms’ discourses. Despite the contribution of previous research through narrative analysis domains, conceptualization of narrative practices remains a relatively neglected area in the extant accounting literature. Design/methodology/approach: The analytical framework is rooted in Aristotle's three pillars of rhetorical proofs: ethos (credibility/trustworthiness), pathos (emotion/identification through cultural domains) and logos (reason/rationale) in investigating narrative extracts regarding persuasive appeals adopted by Carillion's board through annual reports that facilitate discourse regarding Carillion’s strategic choices. Further, the authors emphasis on repetitive rhetorical slogan strategies embedded in the annual reports regarding Carillion's acquisitions strategy. We viewed acquisitions narratives as rhetorical communication artefacts and analyzed the repetitive rhetoric slogans in these corporate documents. Findings: Findings of this study show how persuasive strategies and repetitive slogans trigger the discourses of Carillion's annual reports by drawing on perspectives from upper echelon theory, impression management and communication patterns. Findings reveal that Carillion’ board strategically use repetitive rhetoric slogans to shape optimistic corporate future performance which might be different from the feasible reality. Finally, the authors argue that corporate executives are striving to construct an alternative reality stem from their initial unrealistic aspiration to lead their sector of less controlled market share. Findings of this study have theoretical and managerial implications. Research limitations/implications: The key limitation of this study lies with the case study as the research methodology. Subjectivity remains inherent in interpreting the findings of this study. Future studies may adopt or adapt the authors’ analytical framework to examine other domains underpinning corporate reporting practices. Practical implications: The findings of this study have practical implications for boardrooms and policymakers. Findings of this study have theoretical and managerial implications. The level of optimism has its impact on the mood of financial decision-makers, and when there is a high level of optimism, managers may consider making more investment decisions and therefore making many acquisitions. Managerial overconfidence has been widely documented in the literature. Overconfident managers systematically overestimate the probability of good outcomes (and correspondingly underestimate the probability of bad outcomes) resulting from their actions. Social implications: Managerial overconfidence refers to overestimation of managers' own abilities and outcomes relating to actions which are under their control. Executives believed that they have ultimate control over outcomes, which leads them to underestimate the probability of failure generally. According to self-attribution bias, many people tend to excessively credit their own skills for good results and overly credit external factors for bad outcomes. Originality/value: The study explores the repetitive rhetorical slogan strategies embedded in the annual reports regarding Carillion's acquisitions strategy. Further, the study reveals how Carillion's board engaged through the early report with discourse and repetitive slogans to maintain their legitimacy. Findings reveal that Carillion’s board strategically uses repetitive rhetoric slogans to shape optimistic corporate future performance, which might be different from the feasible reality. Finally, the authors argue that corporate executives are striving to construct an alternative reality stem from their initial unrealistic aspiration to lead their sector of less controlled market share. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Accounting; Acquisitions; Boardroom practices; Corporate disclosure; Corporate governance; Rhetorical analysis; Strategic choices; Strategic investment decision-making,Business and management,Emerald Publishing,Article,Scopus

Analysing a sample of US companies, we find that corporate risk-taking propensity increases when a firm appoints a problem director. Our results are of economic significance, indicating that a one standard deviation increase in problem director's score leads to a 2.33% to 4.17% increase in corporate risk-taking. Mediation analysis reveals that a problem director increases firm risk-taking through reducing financial reporting quality. Further, a firm's risk-taking increases when a new problem director joins the board, and the damaging effect persists even after the problem director has left. Moreover, if a chief executive officer (CEO) is a problem director, s/he displays a greater predisposition for risk-taking. Moreover, when a problem director also sits on a board led by a problem CEO, we determine that the former will have an even greater propensity to take risks. Further analysis determines that the presence of problem directors damages long-term firm value in the aftermath of risk-taking behaviour. Overall, this study provides fresh evidence revealing a web of connections between a problem director, ineffective corporate governance and a decline in firm value. © 2023 The Authors.

In 2017, Zhou and Feng introduced a deep random forest called gcForest that involves several layers of Random Forest-based classifiers. Although gcForest has outperformed several benchmark algorithms on specific datasets in terms of classification accuracy and model complexity, its input features do not ensure better performance when going deeply through layer-by-layer architecture. We address this limitation by introducing a deep ensemble model with a novel feature generation module. Unlike gcForest where the original features are concatenated to the outputs of classifiers to generate the input features for the subsequent layer, we integrate weights on the classifiers’ outputs as augmented features to grow the deep model. The usage of weights in the feature generation process can adjust the input data of each layer, leading the better results for the deep model. We encode the weights using variable-length encoding and develop a variable-length Particle Swarm Optimization method to search for the optimal values of the weights by maximizing the classification accuracy on the validation data. Experiments on a number of UCI datasets confirm the benefit of the proposed method compared to some well-known benchmark algorithms. © 2023 The Author(s)",Deep learning; Ensemble method; Ensemble of classifiers; Feature generation; Multiple classifiers; Random forest,Business and management,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a qualitative research approach and conducts semi-structured interviews with Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) professionals to explore the adoption and utilisation of fourth-generation digital technologies in the construction industry. The semi-structured interviews allowed the participants to elaborate on their experiences, and thematic analysis was employed to identify and analyse significant themes related to the topic. Findings: Accounts from BAME construction professionals reveal that the increased popularity of fourth-generation digital technologies, also known as Industry 4.0 technologies, does not necessarily result in increased usage. This is because many of these new technologies have not been embraced and are unpopular in certain circles. A more significant revelation is the impact of BAME community settings on determining the career pathways of most individuals, which often do not support the construction or digital technology pathways within the construction industry. Research limitations/implications: Research targeting ethnic minorities may not necessarily yield a large response due to the sensitivity of the issues raised. However, conducting a nationwide research with a larger sample size drawn from various locations in the UK could achieve more robust findings and uncover additional issues. Meanwhile, the results of this research can serve as a framework for more extensive investigations. Practical implications: The research offers valuable recommendations to industry and academia regarding the need to address the specific challenges faced by the BAME community in terms of digital technology adoption. These issues are often overlooked in most discussions about digital technology. Originality/value: The study provides critical recommendations that are relevant to Further and Higher Education (HE) institutions, industries, construction organisations, government bodies, etc. Recommendations include a call for collaboration between educational institutions, industry partners and local communities to facilitate awareness and orientation programmes within the community. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Construction; Digital technology; Education; Skills,Business and management,Emerald Publishing,Article,Scopus

The types and characteristics of these devices vary depending on the industry 4.0 and have rapidly increased recently, especially in smart homes. These gadgets can expose users to serious cyber dangers because of a variety of computing constraints and vulnerabilities in the security-by-design concept. The smart home network testbed setup presented in this study is used to evaluate and validate the protection of the smart cyber-physical system. The context-aware threat intelligence and response model identifies the states of the aligned smart devices to distinguish between real-world typical and attack scenarios. It then dynamically writes specific rules for protection against potential cyber threats. The context-aware model is trained on IoT Research and Innovation Lab - Smart Home System (IRIL-SHS) testbed dataset. The labeled dataset is utilized to create a random forest model, which is subsequently used to train and test the context-aware threat intelligence SHS model's effectiveness and performance.

Drawing on a series 40 of in-depth interviews with people who have voluntarily reduced the amount of time they spend in formal employment we use Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to show the mechanisms through which these improvements are likely to occur. SDT is a well-validated psychological theory which suggests there are three innate psychological needs which when fulfilled lead to enhanced wellbeing: relatedness, competence and autonomy. Interviews showed that when people reduced time in formal employment they dedicated more time to activities which increased the likelihood that these three psychological needs would be adequately met. The activities undertaken were also broadly compatible with a degrowth imaginary. These findings are important as they help to develop the empirical case for a transition away from an economic model focused on ever increasing economic growth and instead illustrate the potential individual, social and environmental benefits of a less work focused way of living. © 2022",Autonomy; Care; Degrowth; Self-determination theory; Wellbeing; Working time,Business and management,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Scopus

Using George the Galapagos tortoise as a metaphor for the lack of replication research, it is argued that only by replicating research studies over time can solid theory be developed. For the most part, advertising and marketing communication research consists of non-replicated, one-shot, point-in-time experiments which, once accepted and published by a journal, becomes the litany of the academic community and is then deified by the citation process. The paper begins by reviewing the background of replication research in the marketing communication domain and applies it to current thinking and publication trends. Reasons for the lack of replication research are presented and some conclusions are drawn for those seeking to confirm or challenge existing research.

This study finds dissimilar results for the discretionary accrual and abnormal activity models, it conducts additional analysis that accounts for the innovation to beat the earnings group, and refers to this group as the 'downward' group; another analysis accounts for the innovation to reduce earnings, and refers to this group as the 'upward' group. The results suggest that there is a negative association between discretionary accruals and downward innovation and finds a similar relationship in abnormal activities and the downward group, which indicates the referential value of beating earnings over innovation.

It is verified by different research trials that the sleep-wake cycle directly affects Aβ levels in the brain. The catalytic nature of amyloidosis and the protein aggregation can be understood with the help of enzyme kinetics. During this research, the chemical kinetics of the enzyme and substrate are used to explore the initiation of Alzheimer’s disease, and the associated physiological factors, such as the sleep wake cycles, related to this symptomatology. The model is based on the concentration of the Aβ fibrils, such that the resulting solution from the mathematical model may help to monitor the concentration gradients (deposition) during sleep deprivation. The model proposed here analyzes the existence of two phases in the production of amyloid fibrils in the sleep deprivation condition: a first phase in which the soluble form of amyloid Aβ is dominant and a second phase in which the fibrillar form predominates and suggests that such product is the result of a strong imbalance between the production of amyloid Aβ and its clearance. The time dependent model with delay, helps to explore the production of soluble Aβ amyloid form by a defective circadian cycle. The limitations of the time dependent model are facilitated by the artificial intelligence (AI) time series forecasting tools. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022.

Using various analytical methods, including context analysis, remote sensing, SPSS correlation and the Sankey analysis, the research examines both weekday and weekend data of Manchester Piccadilly and East Didsbury TODs. Remote sensing analysis reveals Manchester Piccadilly TOD as a UHI hotspot due to concentrated human activities and low Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). East Didsbury TOD, on the other hand, experiences lower UHI intensity because of its lower building and population density. The findings highlight the significant impact of land use and urban morphology on UHI intensity. The paper highlights how TOD-generated commercial and entertainment activities contribute to UHI levels in different locations in Manchester. Factors such as high population density and a higher percentage of workers exacerbate the UHI effect in TODs. The relationship between building heights and UHI challenges the conventional assumption of a positive correlation between floor area ratio (FAR) and UHI. These insights are crucial for TOD planning, emphasising the need to carefully consider land use, population density, and building characteristics in shaping the TOD locations. Implementing measures such as reducing heat emissions from commercial and entertainment activities can lessen the UHI intensity. Providing effective shading in TOD streets and shortening the distance to transit stations can encourage sustainable transportation modes like walking and cycling. Ultimately, this paper enhances understanding of the intricate connections between urban morphology and UHI, facilitating the development of environmentally friendly TOD. © 2023",Canyon ratio; Floor area ratio (FAR); Land surface temperature (LST); Normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI); Remote sensing; Sankey diagram; Spearman's rho; SPSS; Transit oriented development (TOD); Urban heat islands (UHI),Business and management,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Scopus

Industry 4.0 readiness models are worthy methods to aid manufacturing organizations in tracking the development of their businesses and operations. Nevertheless, there are different Industry 4.0 readiness models; no work has yet analyzed Industry 4.0 readiness degree and causal effects relationships using fuzzy cognitive maps. This paper proposes an Industry 4.0 readiness model that consists of readiness requirements obtained from the literature and validated through a mixed-method approach, including literature reviews and questionnaires. To validate the proposed Industry 4.0 readiness model, the exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis methods are used. Fuzzy Cognitive Map is utilized to assess readiness, identify relevant concepts to improve readiness degree, implement Industry 4.0, and analyze causal relationships among concepts and dimensions. Through this model and the FCM method, managers can recognize relevant concepts and predict complicated cause-effect relationships among concepts in two states of static and dynamic analyses to increase readiness degree. The paper concludes by emphasizing managerial implications for successful applications in practice as well as future research suggestions on developing the Industry 4.0 readiness model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM); Industry 4.0; Readiness model,Business and management,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

Built by reusing or repurposing mostly reclaimed urban waste products, their design includes the utilisation of low-embodied-energy materials, passive solar heating and cooling, photovoltaic power systems, rainwater harvesting and solar hot water heating, along with black- and greywater-treatment systems. This study explores stakeholder opinions of whether Earthship buildings can contribute towards the future of alternative housing in the UK. Opinions were sought through a questionnaire completed by UK members of online social media groups whose shared focus is related to sustainability (n = 50). The results reveal that the public believe that the main benefits are their minimal environmental impact and also their reliance on renewable energy resources, while the main barriers are identifying suitable building plots and obtaining the necessary planning permissions. Notwithstanding that the participants included in this study already have sustainability interests, it is surmised that the public deem that the general principles of Earthships are an acceptable choice of alternative home/living. However, while the uptake of Earthship homes proves increasingly popular in some parts of the world, the utmost concern within the UK setting is the reality of finding somewhere suitable to build an Earthship and acquiring necessary authorisations to construct the building.  © 2023 Emerald Publishing Limited: All rights reserved.",alternative living; off grid; sustainability; sustainable construction; UN SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production; UN SDG 13: Climate action; UN SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy; waste management,Business and management,ICE Publishing,Article,Scopus

We analyze a model where the choice of financing is affected by moral hazard problem regarding the choice of production scale that favors bank financing, and by the uncertainty about market demand that favors crowdfunding. We argue that long crowdfunding campaigns or campaigns with large targets usually are less efficient in mitigating moral hazard problem than small/short campaigns. We also argue that high-quality firms and firms with potentially large markets will tend to select bank financing while projects with largest amount of investment should select mixed financing where the firm uses a short crowdfunding campaign and a bank loan.

Previously organic and inorganic amendments have been used separately for mitigation of As in rice but there exists a research gap regarding use of them simultaneously. In this study, both pot and field scale investigations were undertaken for four consecutive years in As-contaminated locations to assess the efficacy of zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe)-enriched vermicompost in reducing the As uptake in rice grain. Altogether seven types of vermicompost and three application rates were evaluated. The treatment combination V4D1 (enriched vermicompost V4 applied to soil at 3 t/ha) recorded the lowest soil available As (2.525 mg kg−1) and the highest soil available As (2.982 mg kg−1) was observed with V5D3 (enriched vermicompost V5 applied to soil at 1.5 t/ha). Application of enriched and non-enriched vermicompost reduced As in grain by 58.14 and 31.40% respectively over no vermicompost (control). The partial dependence plot from stepwise regression modelling of different fractions of As revealed that an increase in organically bound As resulted in a decrease in the availability of As and hence uptake by rice. Further, Zn and Fe-enriched vermicompost resulted in increase of iron plaque formation on the root. A significant positive relationship (r = 0.462) was observed between dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB) extractable -Fe andAs. A significant negative correlation (r = ˗0.410) between DCB-Fe and grain As, advocates better root plaque formation resulting a higher capacity to sequester As onto the root surface and reducing its's entry into the rice system. The carcinogenic risk somewhat was benign (TCR of 2.69 × 10−3 and SAMOE of 0.101) against no vermicompost (TCR of 6.64 × 10−3 and SAMOE of 0.04). Therefore enriching vermicompost with ZnSO4 and FeSO4 at 10% dry weight basis (V4) of the composting substrate can lower arsenic build-up in rice grains without affecting yield. © 2023 The Author(s)",Arsenic; Dietary risk; Enriched vermicompost; Fractions; Iron plaque; Rice,Business and management,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Scopus

The market for male skincare products is far more recent and little research has been undertaken on this emerging sector. The practice of men using what was traditionally a product almost solely aimed at women poses some interesting questions about changing gendered identities and practices. Themes emerged from a series of interviews with respondents and key informants from industry about men’s use of skincare products. Based on our findings, we explore the importance of age as a factor in terms of men’s willingness to engage with this form of consumption. Our research showed that men are not comfortable talking with others about their grooming practices. We argue that men’s skincare consumption is an invisible form of consumption. As our findings show, men do not tend to speak openly about whether or not they use moisturiser and other facial skin care products. We concur with Hakim’s (2016) analysis about the pressure for men to continually improve their bodies in order to try to obtain market advantage in a cut-throat neoliberal context. However, with the case of skin care products, men may introspectively gaze in the mirror in contemplation of their improved appearance gained from using facial skincare products but they want this consumption to remain invisible to others. This invisible consumption could be viewed as an indication of wider uncertainty about masculinity in late modernity and the continuing trend for men to feel that there are certain aspects of their life that they feel they should keep to themselves. © The Author(s) 2022.",consumption; identity; invisible consumption; Masculinity; skincare,Business and management,SAGE Publications Ltd,Article,Scopus

This study aims to examine value formation processes within a cosmetics social media brand community and to establish the types of value formation associated with different categories of interactions within a social media brand community. Design/methodology/approach: The research adopted a netnographic approach and followed the operational protocols of netnography. Conversations in one large cosmetics social media brand community were observed and downloaded for analysis over a two-month period. Examples of value-creation and formation processes were identified using netnographic interpretative procedures to develop higher-order themes. Findings: The findings supported the creation of a “Consumer and brand value creation and co-creation framework” highlighting disparate value types within the following interactions: consumer-to-consumer; brand-to-consumer; and consumer-to-brand. The identified value types were specific to the actors (i.e. consumers and brands) involved in value formation processes. The analysis also revealed consumers’ ability to independently generate value through direct interaction with a social media brand community and the brands’ role in supporting consumers in value formation through value facilitation. Originality/value: The pivotal role of disparate actors’ interactions in value formation processes is highlighted, alongside the autonomous ability to form value with the aid of resources stored and shared within the social media brand community. The network of interactions and value-creation processes contribute to a holistic understanding of the interactions in a social media brand community. Furthermore, the research explores and highlights the emerging role of social media brand communities as “value vestiges”. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Brand communities; Brand value; Co-creation; Consumer value; Cosmetics sector; Netnography; Social media; Value co-creation; Value creation; Value formation,Business and management,Emerald Publishing,Article,Scopus

In robustness tests, this effect remains valid across several specifications based on non-U.S. samples, national income-level, alternative measure of economic stability, and a set of endogeneity tests based on propensity score matching estimation. Countries with pre-existing low GDPG mainly suffer from heightened energy insecurity. Further tests reveal that numerous country-specific institutional quality estimates moderate the effect. Finally, the damaging impact of ESR worsens during years of high inflation, geopolitical risk and acts, as well as of escalated war threats.

Sukuk were first launched in Malaysia and are presently available in 29 countries, including the United Kingdom, United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Luxembourg. Despite the global market prevalence of sukuk, asset pricing literature has not yet addressed the pricing mechanism of sukuk, which is inherently different from bonds and equity due to the contractual differences. However, analysts use LIBOR, or the Islamic interbank benchmark rate, as the ad-hoc benchmark to evaluate sukuk performance. In this study, we develop a basic pricing model that captures the common risks in sukuk returns. We identify two risk factors for sukuk that require risk premiums: (a) sukuk market risk and (b) information asymmetry risk. Using these two common sukuk risks factors, investment analysts can estimate the fair value of sukuk more precisely than other ad hoc measures available. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",reference rate; sukuk pricing; systematic risk factors; two factor model,Business and management,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,Article,Scopus

We assessed the websites of 61 European MPAs in thirteen countries using a survey structured by the three pillars of the Convention: access to information, participation in decision-making, and access to justice. We show that while most websites are used to disseminate information, they do not serve yet as participatory instruments. Very few have an area dedicated to public participation in decision-making and, when available, they provide scarce information on the outcomes of public involvement. Most websites provide general information on the MPA conservation objectives, but less than half provide access to reports on the results of management. Few websites provide information on available means to challenge unlawful acts. Websites’ potential as one of the most widely used, easily accessible, cost-effective sources of information and means for interaction with the general public should be better exploited.

Consistent with previous studies, we find that the US and European markets are net global contributors of return and volatility shocks, whilst the Chinese equity markets are gradually becoming influential. Meanwhile, the GCC equity markets have been anet recipient of shocks from oil prices. Our empirical results provide some important insights. Firstly, the net transmission of shocks from oil prices to the GCC markets has been reducing over time. Secondly, the total connectedness nearly doubled in response to the global pandemic.

We use the binomial-match primarily to study the relationship between outcome uncertainty and scoring-rate, particularly for high values of the scoring-rate. Netball has a high scoring-rate and motivates our model development. In the binomial-match framework, we also evaluate rule-variations, and study tactical play in netball. Our analysis suggests that the binomial-match is not a better forecaster than the Poisson-match, but it is better for representing outcome uncertainty and evaluating rule-variations and tactics. In general, we find that the binomial-match implies greater outcome uncertainty than the Poisson match, for a given scoring-rate, and that an alternating-restart is a good rule for reducing the frequency of tied outcomes. For netball in particular, we show that starting the final quarter with possession in a close, balanced match may confer a significant advantage. © Operational Research Society 2021.",competitive balance; forecasting; netball; outcome uncertainty; sport; tactics,Business and management,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,Article,Scopus

Many initiatives have been undertaken to implement different policies and plans in this regard, which require considerable mobilisation of national and international financing. In acquiring climate finance, many barriers can be identified. This paper aims to investigate such barriers to climate financing in Sri Lanka and proposes strategies to address them. Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative research approach was undertaken in this study by conducting ten semi-structured interviews with experts who are involved in climate change policy implementation activities in Sri Lanka. The collected data were analysed using the content analysis method via Nvivo software. Findings: The empirical findings unveil six key barriers and the corresponding root causes to climate financing in Sri Lanka. Inadequate domestic funding for climate actions was captured as the dominant barrier in this direction. This study also revealed that barriers and their root causes are interconnected, leading to many financial limitations in implementing climate actions. The importance of playing a leading role by the government and enabling an integrated approach between the private and public sector organisations were identified as key strategies to combat climate finance barriers. Originality/value: Despite there being studies focusing on climate change and related policies, limited research has been carried out with regard to climate financing. Within this context, this study makes an original contribution in the area of climate financing with particular reference to a developing country like Sri Lanka. Further, the identification of barriers to climate financing, their root causes and strategies to address them also provides an original contribution to theory and practice. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Barriers; Climate actions; Climate change; Climate change policy implementations; Climate finance; Strategies,Business and management,Emerald Publishing,Article,Scopus

Yet remarkably little detailed attention has been given within the field of British industrial relations or even labour history to the contributory causes, characteristic features, impact and broader implications of this violent dimension of the strikers/scabs relationship within industrial militancy. This paper attempts to fill the gap, focusing on one of the most intense and graphic illustrative time periods, the pre-First World War Labour Revolt between 1910-14. Drawing on an extensive range of secondary literature and new archival material, it explores the way in which working class violence as a form of active collective defence became justified by the way in which it was directly provoked by the employers’ encouragement and/or importation of scab labour, combined with the partisan intervention of police, troops, civil authorities and government as a means of attempting to defeat workers’ struggles. In challenging the legitimacy of public order and state power, such action encouraged a culture of community solidarity and self-defence that embraced many local supporters in the mass picketing against ‘blacklegs’. . © 2022 The Author(s).

A pluralistic evaluation framework (PEF) is here presented as a tool for considering diverse kinds of goodness as perceived by diverse stakeholders in the design and evaluation of policies or projects. It arises from considering a suite of aspects of meaning (biotic, economic, aesthetic, etc.) at each of three stages, namely: identifying relevant stakeholders, mapping real-world systems and assessing modes of valuing. This framework, drawing on the philosophical work of Herman Dooyeweerd and Dirk Vollenhoven, offers a joined-up, participatory approach to policymaking. We report pilot trials of the PEF with groups of policymakers at a series of workshops, demonstrating that it provides additional perspectives and unification of core issues and can be used in a wide range of areas of policymaking and project assessment. We also illustrate its potential application to a controversial environmental project and outline how a pluralistic evaluation framework can be used in tandem with existing frameworks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Policy; Process; Reformational philosophy; Social-ecological system; Stakeholder engagement; Value,Business and management,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

This work evaluates the claim in the context of equity and economic efficiency. Findings from the work support the claim. Compared with undeveloped lands particularly in cities, the tax is discriminatory to capital improvements, which situation could incentivise investment in undeveloped lands and be a potential cause for a lot of undeveloped lands, uncompleted and leap-frog developments in cities. It is also not neutral and diminishes the return on capital and the capacity of landlords to keep their buildings in constant repair thereby discouraging capital improvement on land. Coupled with factors like the current poor tax collection, this could affect the revenue mobilisation and socio-economic development efforts of local and central governments. Thus, the tax policy stands a plea for a reform. © 2022 American Real Estate Society.",Economic efficiency; equity; Ghana; real estate; taxation canons,Business and management,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,Article,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach: A Delphi method was used that combined questionnaire-based survey and the analytical hierarchy process to collect quantitative and qualitative data from an expert panel of crisis readiness professionals on how they prioritise and weigh the different strategic criteria, sub-criteria and performance indicators in the context of law enforcement agencies’ traffic response. Findings: The findings of this paper resulted in the identification, ranking and validation of ten key dimensions of crisis readiness clustered into three distinct sets of priority rankings: response planning, resources, training and coordination; information management and communication and risk and hazard assessment; and early warning, legal and institutional frameworks, recovery initiation and property protection. The results additionally established the relative priority of sub-criteria for each criterion and validated a broad set of key performance indicators (KPIs) for the top six ranked criteria. Research limitations/implications: The findings are based on a single case study focused on a specific area of operation within crisis response and one group of organisations of the UAE police sector. This potentially places a constraint on the wider generalisation of the findings to different operational areas and agencies, as they may have different priorities or organisational conditions that have implications for the framework application and the relative importance of certain criteria and sub-criteria. Practical implications: This paper provides strategic guidance in the form of a prioritised list of criteria, sub-criteria and KPIs that can direct efforts to optimise different dimensions of crisis readiness at a strategic and operational level. Originality/value: This paper makes an original contribution in identifying the key criteria and performance indicators of crisis readiness for road traffic situations. The findings contribute a comprehensive strategic readiness framework that supports planning and decision-making for the development of organisational capacities that can enhance response times of police to road traffic crises. This framework ranks dimensions of crisis readiness and key sub-criteria in order of priority and validates the key components of crisis readiness that can support practitioners to structure, standardise and benchmark key processes and elements of crisis response. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Analytic hierarchy process; Delphi method; Performance indicators; Resilience criteria; Road emergencies crisis response,Business and management,Emerald Publishing,Article,Scopus

In particular, the study examines the mediating mechanism of psychological need satisfaction (PNS) in the relationship between the three forms of perceived organisational justice (procedural, distributive and interactional) and organisational identification as well as job involvement. Integrating the P-E fit literature, this study also investigates the under-researched moderating role of person-organisation (P-O) fit. Our findings demonstrate that PNS fully mediates the relationship between perceived justice and organisational identification as well as job involvement. Further, the direct effects of PNS and the indirect effects of perceived justice on both outcomes are found to be stronger when P-O fit is high. Although both distributive and interactional justice are found to influence PNS, the effect of the commonly investigated procedural justice is not found to be significant.

Calls have been made for more adventurous research methods, beyond the positivist versus interpretivist philosophical divide traditionally embraced by the industry. This study analyses the extensive scholarly debates, advancing and advocating philosophical positions to understand construction phenomena, and further narrows down the argument to within the specific domain of cost overrun research. A systematic and chronological literature review of the methodological/philosophical underpinnings of 41 papers was carried out. The papers were selected by following a staged exclusion criterion. The study outcome reveals that similar dialectical debates and methodological conservatism are still evident, with the predominance of mono-paradigm studies in the bulk of the empirical literature. Most of the empirical literature either provides interpretivist theoretical explanations from qualitative data or positivistically analyses quantitative data to provide technical explanations. To this end, mixed paradigm examples are spotlighted, demonstrating the relevance of linking process and product via methodological adventure in cost overrun research. Transcending the paradigmic divide is necessary to develop a more useful and contextually anchored view of practice, essential to mitigate and provide a holistic understanding of what drives cost overruns in public projects. © 2021 The Author(s).

In this case, existing exact solutions like quadratic programming may not be efficient to solve the problem. Many researchers, therefore, used heuristic and metaheuristic approaches in order to deal with the problem. This work presents Asexual Reproduction Optimization (ARO), a model-free metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the asexual reproduction, in order to solve the portfolio optimization problem including cardinality constraint to ensure the investment in a given number of different assets and bounding constraint to limit the proportions of fund invested in each asset. This is the first time that this relatively new metaheuristic is applied in the field of portfolio optimization, and we show that ARO results in better quality solutions in comparison with some of the well-known metaheuristics stated in the literature. To validate our proposed algorithm, we measured the deviation of the obtained results from the standard efficient frontier. We report our computational results on a set of publicly available benchmark test problems relating to five main market indices containing 31, 85, 89, 98, and 225 assets. These results are used in order to test the efficiency of our proposed method in comparison to other existing metaheuristic solutions. The experimental results indicate that ARO outperforms Genetic Algorithm (GA), Tabu Search (TS), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in most of test problems. In terms of the obtained error, by using ARO, the average error of the aforementioned test problems is reduced by approximately 20 percent of the minimum average error calculated for the above-mentioned algorithms. © 2022 University of Nigeria, Institute of African Studies.

Hypotheses were tested using two-phase survey data collected from 301 SDMs of Sri Lankan accommodation establishments. Clarifying previous inconsistent findings regarding the role of learning, this study demonstrated that training and past disaster experience indirectly influenced SDMs’ planning intentions via their disaster cognition and attitude toward disaster planning. In this regard, past experience was found to regulate the relationship of training with both cognition and attitude, implying that disaster training programs may be more influential for encouraging disaster planning intentions of lesser experienced SDMs by stimulating their disaster cognition and attitude. © The Author(s) 2023.",attitude; disaster cognition; disaster management planning; tourism accommodation industry; training,Business and management,SAGE Publications Ltd,Article,Scopus

Yet, as China’s own football infrastructure matures and foreign clubs seek to establish new fanbases there, little is known about Chinese football fans themselves, the ways in which they express their fandom, or the methods by which they consume football. This study aims to take a first step in identifying and exploring football fandom in the People’s Republic of China, with a view to critically understanding the context out of which it has emerged, and its likely trajectory of development in the short-to-medium term. Adopting an inductive approach to survey research to explore the attitudes, behaviours and activities of Chinese football fans, an online survey resulting in 710 usable responses was conducted on a Chinese online survey platform Wenjuanxing (问卷星) for three weeks in March 2018. Our research identifies similarities with fandom found elsewhere in the world, yet with key differences generally characteristic of Chinese football fans resulting from the geography, distance and league structures of China’s domestic football infrastructure. A tendency to support more than one club, often one domestic and one foreign club, is also noted, with distinct methods of consumption which eschew traditional forms such as match attendance. © 2021 Global Alliance of Marketing & Management Associations (GAMMA).",authenticity; engagement; Fans; identity; transnationalism,Business and management,Routledge,Article,Scopus

Numerous attempts to minimize As accumulation in rice have been researched till date. The current investigation evaluates the relative susceptibility of different growth stages of rice plant to As stress in terms of As accumulation in grain at maturity using sixty treatment combinations. Our findings suggest that supplementing with selenium (Se) resulted in minimizing As content significantly (at P < 0.001 level) in grain, irrespective of growth stages where As stress was introduced. The findings registered the following order of susceptibility to As stress: flowering > grain filling > maximum tillering. Our findings also showed that Se primed rice plants restricts majority of As accumulation in the root itself and minimizes As translocation to the above ground part. The results of this study shows that cultivation of Se primed seeds can be (i) an effective means to minimize As accumulation in rice, and (ii) potential mode of biofortification of rice grain with essential nutrient elements {iron (8.47–10.17 mg L-1), zinc (7.14–8.05 mg L-1), manganese (17.92–19.71 mg L-1) and copper (3.18–3.28 mg L-1)} improving the recommended dietary intake of micronutrients, an invaluable strategy especially for malnourished rice dependent populations. Using machine learning this study also predicts that the Se concentration of 0.862 mg L−1 could be the most effective input in minimizing As content and enhancing other micronutrient content, irrespective of As stress. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",As stress; Growth stages; RDI; Rice; Selenium seed priming,Business and management,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Scopus

However, little attention has been paid to the role of OB in improving the financial well-being of the growing number of the EU’s underserved groups, which currently constitute approximately a quarter of its population. This study examines how the PSD2 and OB impact inclusive finance in the EU based on the perspectives of the Netherlands’ ecosystem, one of the leaders in the EU’s financial technology (FinTech) landscape. A fundamental distinction can be drawn between the OB users and the ecosystem’s players. Regarding the impact of financial services on the users’ inclusivity, while the PSD2 strengthens the infrastructure necessary for financial inclusion, many challenges remain, mainly because it was not designed for this purpose. This study identifies several areas of improvement that include adjustments to the know your customer and anti-money laundering processes for underserved customers, innovative ways to communicate the PSD2’s potential, and the regulation of technology providers’ activities to build trust. Meanwhile, from the ecosystem’s position, there is a need to strengthen and improve microfinance regulation according to the opportunities provided by the PSD2 to support microfinance institutions (MFIs) in scaling up and reaching underserved clients across borders with innovative services. OB improvements can also be achieved by organizations formed by MFIs and FinTechs in collaboration with banks. Such hybrid institutions will combine the best features of each of them: knowledge of the needs of local underserved clients from MFIs, technological innovations from FinTechs, and large and trusted customer bases, infrastructures, and access to institutional investments and governments from banks. Finally, an EU inclusive OB sector depends on the centrality of trusted regulators as coordination bodies. © 2023, The Author(s).",Ecosystems; FinTech; Inclusive finance; Open banking; The European Union; The Netherlands; The Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2),Business and management,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Article,Scopus

In doing so, the study responds to calls for further, empirical research on both the experiences of female sports fans and the darker side of social media. Research methods: An exploratory, qualitative research design is adopted, comprising in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 15 female fans of European professional football clubs. Interview data is analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results and findings: The study contributes novel evidence to the fields of social media, social capital and football fandom, revealing that the male hegemony of football fandom is reinforced through social media. This leads to modified online behaviour by female fans, whereby micro-communities are formed in which they discuss football. The splintering of the online fan community into these micro-communities represents a form of cyberbalkanization and has implications for female fans’ ability to build bridging social capital on social media. Implications: This study responds to calls for a more theoretically informed approach to social media research in sport, drawing on theories of social capital and performative sport fandom to understand the strategies employed by female fans in performing their fandom on social media. The findings raise questions of how professional sports clubs can engage female audiences and champion inclusive cultures of fandom. © 2021 European Association for Sport Management.",cyberbalkanization; female fans; football; social capital; Social media,Business and management,Routledge,Article,Scopus

While various forms of data exist, the mental databases of stakeholders, accessible through interviews, are considered most crucial. Nevertheless, a structured and systematic interview and data analysis process is imperative. While most established methods for systematically analysing qualitative data rely on grounded theory approach, this study introduces an innovative coding technique. This method combines the principles of thematic analysis, saliency analysis (an extension of thematic analysis) framework, case study approach, and key features of existing coding methods. This proposed approach emphasizes (i) coding data across all stakeholder groups, (ii) determining causal relationships from stakeholders’ causal attributions and transforming these relationships into causal maps, and (iii) establishing and maintaining explicit links between causal maps and their data source through a data source reference table and software. To demonstrate the practical application of this coding approach, it was applied to a study focusing on the cost performance of road infrastructure projects in Nigeria, where 16 semi-structured interviews were analysed. The findings indicate that the formulated coding approach provided a comprehensive, rigorous, and well-documented framework for coding qualitative data. This facilitated the development of a data-driven conceptual model that captures the intricate interplay of key determinants leading to cost overruns in road infrastructure projects in Nigeria. © 2023 by the author(s).",Coding Framework; Dynamic Modelling; Model Conceptualization; Qualitative Data; Road Infrastructure Project; System Dynamics,,Australian Institute of Quantity Surveyors,Article,Scopus

This research contributes to theory and practice by adopting a sociotechnical approach (STS) to understand the technical and social implications of learning management systems (LMS) to inform pedagogical development. A qualitative approach is adopted, and semi-structured interviews are conducted across two university cases with 40 academics and students to capture their perceptions of LMS usage. We found that technical paradoxes present a barrier to pedagogical development in the transition from blended learning environments to remote ones, where many wicked and unprecedented challenges emerge from learning remotely during a pandemic, while social paradoxes arise from cultural issues such as user resistance that impede the university's pedagogical goals and visions. © 2023 The Authors.

Many studies focus on technical aspects, lacking an assessment of environmental impacts associated with using these alternative materials, and the contribution to the sustainability of the sector remains unclear. In this paper, we present the development of lightweight blocks containing the finest fractions of waste concrete along with a holistic study of the developed product's structural and environmental performance. The results demonstrate the feasibility of such a recycling strategy and its environmental benefits. However, despite replacing 60 wt.% of portland cement in the developed lightweight blocks, their carbon footprint is not negligible, and to reduce CO2 emissions in the construction sector significantly will require holistic measures that promote the reuse of whole building elements instead of their disintegration and subsequent recycling. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Aerated concrete; Construction and demolition waste; LCA; Masonry blocks; Recycling,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach: The article uses the qualitative method of autoethnography to provide a highly personalised account of the first author’s relationships with podcast hosts during his time as an educational tourist, in order to fulfil its previously mentioned purpose. Findings: An analysis of the author’s narrative account demonstrates how he formed parasocial relationships (PSRs) with his favourite podcast hosts. These relationships increased self-efficacy, reduced stress and provided a sense of social support, which, in turn contributed to psychological and sociocultural adjustment. Originality/value: By demonstrating how relationships with media figures can impact their psychological and sociocultural adjustment, this article argues that research on educational tourists should explore their PSRs, in addition to their other kinds of friendships which have already been examined. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Adjustment; Autoethnography; Educational tourists; Parasocial relationships; Podcasts,,Emerald Publishing,Article,Scopus

Using 2015 European Working Conditions Survey data, this study contributes to these debates by exploring the relationships between job quantity, job quality and employees' mental health. Overall, we find that a job's quality matters more than its quantity as measured in hours per week. The results show that actual working hours are hardly related to employees' mental health but job quality, especially intrinsically meaningful work, less intensified work and having a favourable social environment, has positive effects on employee mental health, even in jobs with short working hours. Moreover, although working less than one prefers (under-employment) has negative effects, these negative effects become much smaller in size and non-significant in good quality jobs, especially in jobs with skill discretion and good job prospects. These findings develop the debates about a shorter standard working week by emphasising the continued and crucial importance of job quality in debates on the future of work. These results also suggest that policymakers should pay particular attention to job quality when addressing the dramatic reduction in total hours of employment in Europe following the COVID-19 crisis.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

In these industrial systems, the industrial internet of things (IIoT) significantly improves system efficiency, scalability, ease of control, and monitoring. These benefits have been achieved at the cost of greater security risks, thus making the system vulnerable to cyberattacks. Historically, industrial networks and systems lacked security features like authentication and encryption due to intended isolation over the Internet. Lately, remote access to these IIoT systems has made an attempt of holistic security alarmingly critical. In this research paper, a threat modeling framework for smart cyber–physical system (CPS) is proposed to get insight of the potential security risks. To carry out this research, the smart firefighting use case based on the MITRE ATT&CK matrix was investigated. The matrix analysis provided structure for attacks detection and mitigation, while system requirement collection (SRC) was applied to gather generic assets’ information related to hardware, software and network. With the help of SRC and MITRE ATT&CK, a threat list for the smart firefighting system was generated. Conclusively, the generated threat list was mapped on the national institute of standards and technology (NIST) security and privacy controls. The results show that these mapped controls can be well-utilized for protection and mitigation of threats in smart firefighting system. In future, critical cyber–physical systems can be modeled upon use case specific threats and can be secured by utilizing the presented framework. © 2023 The Author(s)",Cyber–Physical System (CPS); IIoT; IoT; NIST controls; Smart firefighting system; Smart industrial system; Threat modeling,,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

However, the evidence is inconsistent and does not support the assumed negative relationship between civil war and FDI. Some studies suggest that FDI enters countries with internal armed conflicts unabated; others show that civil war economies exhibit strong increases in FDI during conflict. Underpinned by a liberal interpretation of war, this scholarship finds these trends to be surprising, counter-intuitive and curious, arguing that FDI enters conflict zones in spite of violence. In contrast, critical perspectives can provide insights by acknowledging that violence can facilitate economic processes such as FDI, creating a particular form of security and stability that can be conducive to FDI inflows. This article examines the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983-2005), a country which exhibited strong increases in FDI during phases of the conflict. It is argued that particular types of violence perpetrated by the government’s armed forces and pro-government militias–groups which were sympathetic to the interests of key investors in the oil industry–facilitated FDI in Sudan’s oil sector during the 2000s to the detriment of large sections of the civilian population affected by the violence. © 2022 The Author(s).

In the North Sea, marine spatial planning (MSP) processes include co-existence strategies, with co-location between fisheries and offshore wind farms often discussed. However, current legal regulations and the lack of adequate scientific evidence to document economic viability of proposed passive gears, coupled with uncertainties regarding the implementation approach, continue to limit progress in developing co-location solutions. We synthesized current regulations and practices relevant to offshore wind farms and fisheries and conducted spatial-temporal overlap analysis of pot and trap fisheries targeting crustaceans in offshore wind farms to understand their potential for co-location. Our results showed the largest potential for co-location of pot and trap fisheries targeting crustaceans is located in OWFs that already exist or will be constructed until 2030. We also identified 1) gaps in fisheries and (OWF) regulations and 2) sector challenges that hindered the successful implementation of fisheries and offshore wind farm co-location. We discuss and recommend enabling conditions, including more science-based evidence on socio-economic and ecological viability of passive fisheries in offshore areas. Experiments on pot and trap gear safety and spillover evidence of artificial reef effects (AREs) are needed to inform the implementation of new safety distances and economically beneficial passive fisheries. Finally, we highlight needs for new insurance regimes and straightforward funding provision to support transitions to co-location and absorb the shocks from mobile fisheries displacement. © 2023 The Authors",Co-existence; Co-location; Fisheries co-management; Offshore renewables,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Scopus

The integration of IoT networks with the metaverse will enable more meaningful connections between the 'real' and 'virtual' worlds, allowing for real-time data analysis, access, and processing. However, these metaverse-IoT networks will face numerous security and privacy threats. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) offer an effective means of early detection for such attacks. Nevertheless, the metaverse generates substantial volumes of data due to its interactive nature and the multitude of user interactions within virtual environments, posing a computational challenge for building an intrusion detection system. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an innovative intrusion detection system model based on deep learning. This model aims to detect most attacks targeting metaverse-IoT communications and combines two techniques: KPCA (Kernel Principal Component Analysis which was used for attack feature extraction and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks for attack recognition and classification. The efficiency of this proposed IDS model is assessed using two widely recognized benchmark datasets, BoT-IoT and ToN-IoT, which contain various IoT attacks potentially targeting IoT communications. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed IDS model in identifying 12 classes of attacks relevant to metaverse-IoT, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.8% and a False Negative Rate FNR less than 0.2. Furthermore, when compared with other models in the literature, our IDS model demonstrates superior performance in attack detection accuracy. © 2023 The Author(s)",CNN; Convolutional neural network; Internet of Things; Intrusion detection; IoT attacks; Kernel principal component analysis; Metaverse; Security and privacy,,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopt the Bloomberg ESG rating to measure the extent of ESG disclosure using a sample of 1,260 observations from BRICS emerging economies. Multiple regression techniques were used to estimate the effect of board characteristics on ESG disclosures of a sample Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) listed companies between 2010 and 2019. Findings: The authors find a relatively low (at 37%) level of ESG disclosure among the sampled firms and a relatively high degree of variability. The authors also find that board gender diversity, board composition and board diligence are positively related to the level of ESG disclosure while the study documents no relationship between board size and ESG disclosure. Practical implications: The study’s findings highlight the importance of corporate board attributes in influencing strategic decisions such as the level of ESG disclosure and the findings may be useful to regulators, policymakers and investors in making informed investment decisions.

Drawing on the first in-depth research into veteran’s interactions with the UK’s Public Employment Services (PES) and other contracted providers, we present analysis of qualitative longitudinal data from 68 veterans. We demonstrate the important role ALMPs play in mediating the employment relationship, showing how veterans claiming out-of-work benefits are typically either ‘pushed’ towards inappropriate jobs or ‘parked’ through their exclusion from employment support when deemed unfit for work. This not only exposes veterans and other jobseekers to poor quality work but undermines both job match and inclusive employment practices. Furthermore, the potential for more positive outcomes through engagement with employers and HRM practitioners is not being realised. This is significant for veterans in the UK and beyond, where policymakers make broader commitments to post-Service integration into civilian employment. We critique Work First approaches centred on those deemed work ready and contribute to broader theorisation around interactions between the state and HRM, arguing the need for pluralist approaches which incorporate ALMPs. © 2022 The Author(s).

More specifically, we identify how conditionality drives welfare recipients’ experience of four core dimensions of job quality: disempowering and propelling claimants towards inadequate pay, insecurity and poor employment terms, undermining multiple intrinsic characteristics of work and creating what we term a new ‘Work–Life–Welfare balance’. Instead of acting as a neutral arbitrator between jobseekers and employers, the welfare system is exposed as complicit in reinforcing one-sided flexibility through one-sided conditionality, by emphasising intensive job-seeking, while leaving poor-quality work provided by employers unchecked. © The Author(s) 2024.",job quality; sanctions; social security; welfare conditionality; Work–Life–Welfare balance,,SAGE Publications Ltd,Article,Scopus

This article uses an intersectional analytical framework and a cross-sectional quantitative analysis of the British Workplace Behaviour Survey (2007–2008) to examine bullying in the workplace, as experienced by the intersections of ethno-racial status and gender. In discussing how some groups report particular dimensions of bullying more than others, this article closely examines the somewhat unexpected finding that ‘white’ men were significantly more likely to report instances of workplace bullying.

Its aims, as well as efforts undertaken as part of its praxis, are reminders that collaborative engagements with individuals and communities can simultaneously serve to commemorate, educate and empower. Recent scholarship that examines pop-up events underscores both their significance to public history and the innovative potential they represent in celebrating LGBT+ lives and experiences. In particular, the extent to which they encourage considerations of space that are more attentive to localities and pluralities is indicative of the disruptive significance of small-scale events. Among other possibilities that lend themselves to expanding the reach of public history, particularly by adopting new modes of interpretation that place a premium on active engagement, creative arts programming provides a pathway to stimulating interest in exploring and understanding the past.

COVID-19 resulted in an acceleration of the shift to online service delivery and temporary and permanent branch closures among community finance institutions. Further, the demand for, and volume and value of lending fell significantly during the first lockdown only recovering by the end of the summer 2020. This resulted in lower income, greater costs and lower regulatory ratios. Smaller providers in a weak financial position with more financially vulnerable customers were worst affected by the pandemic. We argue the pandemic may reduce access to finance for the financially excluded through the intensification of the shift to online services and by increasing the risk of providers serving the poorest folding or being merged with larger providers. © The Author(s) 2023.",community finance; coronavirus; COVID-19; credit union; financial inclusion,,SAGE Publications Ltd,Article,Scopus

Failure prediction studies have mainly relied on using financial ratios as predictors. The most suitable financial predictors for banks are financial ratios following the CAMEL rating system. Also, corporate governance has been proven to be an important aspect of banks, especially after the financial crisis. Given its importance, the novelty of this paper is to test the ability of corporate governance to increase the accuracy and extend the time-horizon of bank failure prediction in the US market. Using discriminant analysis, we predict the failure of banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation from 2010 to 2018. Using financial and non-financial predictors, we find that combining CAMEL ratios with corporate governance variables not only increases the accuracy of prediction but also extends the time horizon to three years before failure. We also show that bank earnings is a more significant predictor than capital structure and asset quality. The results further reveal that CEO compensation, voting rights and institutional ownership are significant predictors. These results are robust when using logit regression and out-of-sample examination. This study shows that corporate governance plays a key role in the success or failure of banks. The regulatory implication of this paper is that more attention needs to be directed to corporate governance and earnings aspects of banks rather than focusing on capital structure. © 2023, The Author(s).",Bank failure; CAMEL ratios; Corporate governance; Failure prediction,,Springer,Article,Scopus

This study explores the impact of climate change on SMEs' innovation from a resource-based view (RBV) standpoint. Using the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation of panel data for 443 SMEs from 14 developing countries during the period 2007–2016, we found that climate change has a significant positive impact on SMEs' innovation performance. In economic terms, climate change of one standard deviation variation resulted in a 6.6 % increase in innovation investment. Interesting results emerged when the sample was divided into firms with high and low growth, high and low profit, and high and low slack resources, and industries with high and low vulnerability. The results show that SMEs' innovation response to climate change may vary substantially across firms and industries. In high-growth, high-slack-resources firms, and in highly profitable and non-vulnerable industries, SMEs' innovation responds positively to climate change. Our study contributes to the SME and climate change literature by being the first to examine the impact of climate change on SMEs' innovation. Managerial and policy implications are discussed. © 2022 The Authors",Climate change; Developing countries; Innovation; SMEs,,Elsevier Inc.,Article,Scopus

In turn, researchers active across the social sciences and beyond have responded and are beginning to carve out a new field of study–digital football studies. In the absence of any concentrated review of this field, the purpose of this paper is threefold: (1) to critically revisit previous ‘waves’ of football studies scholarship; (2) to identify themes in current digital football studies scholarship and identify areas for future study; and (3) to begin to map out some theoretical and conceptual traditions that might better equip scholarly enterprises for the study of football, and by association leisure and sport, in the (hyper)digital moment. We also postulate the establishment of digital football studies as a collective enterprise will be especially important for a post-Covid-19 globe given the rapid acceleration towards digital during the pandemic. To this end, we argue that leisure and football studies must develop empirically, methodologically, and theoretically to better capture the nature of (hyper)digitalised societies and the ways audiences are playing with, and shifting, the boundaries and possibilities for football and leisure. © 2021 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: The paper has used panel data from 140 countries covering the period of 2007–2016 and has analysed the data by using generalised method of moments instrumental variables (GMM-IV) estimation method to control for unobserved endogeneity among the variables. Findings: The authors find that terrorism has negative impact on innovation. Interesting results emerge when we separated the developed countries from others. The results show that the impact of terrorism on innovation is lower in developed countries. This is due to the fact that strong institutional settings in developed countries make the investors confident by providing support and incentives. Better institutional settings in developed countries also help to reduce uncertainty, which maximise innovation and minimise terrorism risk. The authors also find that venture capital positively moderates the terrorism and innovation relationship. This implies that by providing sufficient fund for technological development, venture capital may help to reduce terrorism risk. Practical implications: These results may guide the policy makers to find a business solution instead of lengthy political solution to mitigate terrorism risk in emerging countries. Overall, this paper will provide the basis for improving the counter-terrorism approaches from an innovation perspective. Originality/value: The paper has used terrorism and venture capital data from 140 countries and finds interesting results that may help the policy makers to reduce the effect and intensity of terrorism in emerging countries. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Emerging markets; Innovation; Terrorism; Venture capital,,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,Article,Scopus
Lou E.C.W.; Lee A.; Lim Y.M.,"Stakeholder preference mapping: the case for built heritage of Georgetown, Malaysia",Journal of Cultural Heritage Management and Sustainable Development,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102922385&doi=10.1108%2fJCHMSD-08-2020-0114&partnerID=40&md5=29572e8c6d30e6a87957fbe7ffc69efb,"Purpose: While there is an established body of literature that discusses the importance of stakeholder management, and also the need for involvement of all stakeholders so that all values of a heritage site can be captured in a heritage management plan, the concepts are not generally developed in ways that make them useful in practice. This research seeks to bring greater clarity to the practice of stakeholder engagement in built heritage, so that organisations can manage their stakeholders in ways that meet their strategic goals. This study proposes a novel method to identify stakeholders, a stakeholder preference mapping approach, which will depict their influence on decisions based on a of power-interest scale. Design/methodology/approach: This research posits a stakeholder preference mapping approach. Virtual Stakeholder Groups (VSG) were identified and stakeholder's significance impacts were measured using the RIBA Plan of Work 2013 to determine in-depth consideration of each stakeholder's power and interest against differing stages of a heritage project. Participants were convened through a 5-day workshop, consisting of 20 Malaysian and 19 international participants (80% academics and 20% Malaysian civil servants). The Multi-Attribute Decision Analysis (MADA) technique was then used to demonstrate how stakeholder identification and analysis can be used to help heritage teams meet their mandates. Findings: The research identified eight virtual VSG (Extremist, Expert, Economic, Social, Governance and Tourists) and their scale of power-interest influence at different stages of the heritage management process. The findings reveal varying levels of engagement from each of the different groups of stakeholders at each work stage – with Stage 5 (Construction) being the least engaged. Originality/value: It is anticipated that through stakeholder preference mapping, heritage teams can increase the robustness of their strategies by identifying and effectively managing the important concepts; heritage teams can effectively manage the interface between the many (often competing) demands of differing stakeholders. Using Georgetown as a case study, the research team were able to delineate the interaction and interplay between the various stakeholders in the complex decision-making processes for a UNESCO heritage site. Applying the RIBA 2013 Plan of Work as a framework to the heritage management process enables a formalised mapping approach to the process. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Georgetown; Malaysia; Multi-attribute decision analysis; Stakeholder analysis; Virtual stakeholder groups; World heritage,,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,Article,Scopus
