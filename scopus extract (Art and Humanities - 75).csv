Powell S.,"Lydgate, Chaucer, and Lady Margaret Beaufort",Chaucer Review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168990429&doi=10.5325%2fCHAUCERREV.58.3-4.0506&partnerID=40&md5=a8707065b229c96c2cd2d56ad14cca83,"In an early book on Lydgate, Derek Pearsall was dismissive of Lydgate’s verse legend of Saint Margaret of Antioch. While perhaps of limited literary interest, the poem merits some claim to attention in its occurrence in the Devonshire Chaucer (New Haven, Yale Beinecke Library MS Takamiya 24). There it is paired with the Canterbury Tales in a context that has led to the suggestion that the manuscript might be the Canterbury Tales bequeathed by Lady Margaret Beaufort (1443–1509), Countess of Richmond and Derby, and mother of Henry VII, to her nephew of the half-blood, John St. John. This article refines the argument and offers an explanation for its early provenance in the Knyvett family. It explores the circumstances of the commissioning of Lydgate’s poem, and the context in which it might have circulated singly and been selected for adding to a manuscript of the Canterbury Tales, a context that reveals a network of family connections—Staffords, Hollands, Beauchamps, Beauforts, Knyvetts, and Bourchiers. © 2023 Penn State University Press.

After The Royle Family creator Caroline Aherne’s death in July 2017, the BBC created a bursary in memory of the comedy star, awarding £5,000 to the successful applicant to develop a pilot comedy script. Though open to people of all backgrounds and genders, the three winners so far have been working-class women – Sophie Willan, Amy Gledhill and Kiri Pritchard-McLean – an important shift from the recent success of female-fronted and female-authored middle-class comedies on the BBC such as Miranda and Fleabag. This article examines the award’s first winner: Boltonian Sophie Willan and her series Alma’s Not Normal. While Phil Wickham argues that contemporary working-class sitcoms in Britain display the ‘hidden injuries of class’, something that is felt but no longer acknowledged, I contend that Willan exposes class wounds by explicitly referencing and drawing attention to social issues in her TV series. More specifically, I argue that, as a working-class woman in the North West, Willan uses comedy to interrogate the intersections of class and gender. This textual analysis will then be used as a framework to conceptualise the labour of working-class women in British television comedy, mainly because class has been overlooked as a social category in contemporary scholarship on feminism and humour. © Edinburgh University Press.",Alma’s Not Normal; BBC; Caroline Aherne; situation comedy; Sophie Willan; working-class women,Art and Humanities,Edinburgh University Press,Article,Scopus

Governing and aligning Agile architecture across autonomous squads (i.e., teams), when using the Spotify model, is a challenge because the Spotify model lacks practices for addressing Agile architecture governance. To explore how software architecture can be governed and aligned by scaling the Spotify model, we conducted a longitudinal embedded case study in a multinational FinTech organisation. Then, we developed and evaluated an approach for architectural governance by conducting an embedded case study. The collected data was analysed using Thematic Analysis and informed by selected Grounded Theory techniques such as memoing, open coding, constant comparison, and sorting. Our approach for architectural governance comprises an organisational structure change and an architecture change management process. The benefits reported by the practitioners include devolving architectural decision-making to the operational level (i.e., Architecture Owners), enhancing architectural knowledge sharing among squads, minimising wasted effort in architectural refactoring, and other benefits. The practitioners in our case study realised an improved squad autonomy by the ability to govern and align architectural decisions. We provide two key contributions in this paper. First, we present the characteristics of our proposed architectural governance approach, its evaluation, benefits, and challenges. Second, we present how the novel Heterogeneous Tailoring model was enhanced to accommodate our architectural governance approach. © 2021, The Author(s).",Agile architecture; FinTech; Grounded Theory; Large-scale Agile developments; Spotify Tailoring; Thematic analysis,Art and Humanities,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Article,Scopus

But how does working with high BLM supervisors affect employees’ functioning both at work and at home? Guided by this question, we draw on social information processing theory and insights from the person–environment fit literature for a nuanced understanding of the effects of supervisor BLM. Using data from two field studies conducted in China (340 employees) and the United States (174 employees), we find that supervisor BLM increases employee perceptions of a competitive climate that ultimately increases employee thriving at work and insomnia outside work. We further find that employee trait competitiveness moderated the indirect relationship (via perceived competitive climate) between supervisor BLM and thriving at work but not for insomnia; employees high (versus low) in trait competitiveness were found to thrive at work under the competitive climate stimulated by high BLM supervisors. Taken together, our findings highlight the need for organizational leaders to be cautious of being too narrowly focused on bottom-line outcomes and aware of the wider implications of BLM on different domains of their employees’ lives. © The Author(s) 2020.",insomnia; perceived competitive climate; supervisor bottom-line mentality; thriving at work; trait competitiveness,Art and Humanities,SAGE Publications Ltd,Article,Scopus

Taking its cue from the biological structure of fungal mycelium, from whose flowers the psychoactive compounds of many psychedelic drugs are derived, this study builds on established models of EDM’s affectivity to propose that timbre in EDM manifests a psychedelic and specifically social form of consciousness. Highlighting the potential for entrainment that EDM’s synthesised timbres make possible, a conception of timbre as a mycelial “zone of entanglement” is put forward, in which the material and cultural, individual and social and spiritual and fleshly dimensions of the listening experience are folded into a reverberant unity, in turn encouraging a negotiation of the ethics that this entanglement entails. © 2023 Dancecult.",electronic dance music; mycelium; ontology; psychedelics; timbre,Art and Humanities,National University of Ireland Maynooth,Article,Scopus

Yet, despite this, how the specific qualities of short fiction can expand on existing modes remains theoretically underexplored. This article offers an intervention into the aforementioned field through an exploration into how the qualities of brevity and experiment that are associated with short fiction can be employed to mirror and synthesize aspects of the psychoanalyst Carl Jung’s ground-breaking work on the unconscious and his narrative approaches to processing trauma. First, this article presents the short story ‘Disappearing Act’, a hybrid of memoir and short fiction based on a personal traumatic experience of childhood abuse and informed by the Jungian concept of individuation (commonly referred to in contemporary psychoanalytic circles as shadow work). Second, it includes an accompanying critical reflection on the story’s creative process and the ways in which autobiographical short fiction can be employed as a mode of shadow work to demonstrate how the form operated as a creatively rich device to process traumatic life material for this writer. © 2022 Intellect Ltd Article.

However, little is known about what makes people want to read fiction online, especially in a foreign-language setting. As part of the growth of digital literature and cybernetics, online fiction is gaining popularity among young Indonesians. This research sought to explore Indonesian student-readers’ motivations and preferences as they practiced and were engaged in reading online stories in English. One hundred twelve university students responded to a survey, and 14 were randomly selected for in-depth interviews to learn more about their reading motivations, preferences, and cybernetic literary practices. Analysis of data from the survey showed that most participants chose Wattpad and Webtoon as their favorite online platforms, with romance and fantasy as their favorite genres. They devoted many hours to reading novels on these platforms to seek enjoyment and improve their English vocabulary and language. Nevertheless, data from the interviews further revealed that readers read solely to seek enjoyment and pleasure. Also, readers were primarily silent, unwilling to participate in online conversations between readers and reader-authors but actively rating the novels after reading. Findings contribute to establishing views on online reading motivation and cybernetic literary practices for EFL fiction readers; reading for pleasure is the intrinsic motivation that triggers Indonesian university student-readers to stay online on the platform. © 2023 authors.

The hunting patterns of urban hunters in Amazonia, and the similarities with those of rural hunters, are unclear, as are the social factors that influence hunting practices. We analyze the effects of socioeconomic and cultural factors on hunting frequency and composition of species hunted by urban and rural Amazonian hunters. We interviewed 49 urban hunters and 57 rural hunters within 10 municipalities in western Amazonia in Brazil. A total of 44 species were cited as hunted. Our analyses show that the probability of engaging in sport hunting (for recreation) is greater among urban hunters. Rural inhabitants, hunters with lower monetary incomes, and hunters who were non-practicing Christians and atheists hunted more frequently. The composition of species hunted was similar, regardless of the hunters’ livelihood (rural or urban) or religion. We found that hunting frequency is influenced by hunters’ socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds, but these factors do not affect the composition of the harvest. This similarity between urban and rural hunters might be related to species distribution and availability and could potentially impact the most hunted species if hunting grounds overlap. Understanding hunting patterns, especially those of urban hunters, allows for more effective hunting management strategies, improvements in law enforcement against illegal hunting, as well as development of more effective and sustainable conservation actions. © The Author(s) 2023.",Amazon; Brazil; Bushmeat; Livelihoods; Sport Hunting; Tropical Forests,Art and Humanities,Springer,Article,Scopus

In this context, 360° videos are becoming ubiquitous and especially suitable for providing immersive experiences thanks to the proliferation of affordable devices. This new medium has an untapped potential for the inclusion of modern subtitles to foster media content accessibility (Gejrot et al., 2021), e.g., for the deaf or hard-of-hearing people, and to also promote cultural inclusivity via language translation (Orero, 2022). Prior research on the presentation of subtitles in 360° videos relied on subjective methods and involved a small number of participants (Brown et al., 2018; Agulló, 2019; Oncins et al., 2020), leading to inconclusive results. The aim of this paper is to compare two conditions of subtitles in 360° videos: position (head-locked vs fixed) and colour (monochrome vs colour). Empirical analysis relies on novel triangulation of data from three complementary methods: psycho-physiological attentional process measures (eye movements), performance measures (media content comprehension), and subjective task-load and preferences (self-report measures). Results show that head-locked coloured subtitles are the preferred option. © 2023 The Author(s).

In social science, judgemental rationality involves acting upon plausible decisions about competing points of view. However, the tools for doing this are, as yet, under-articulated. This paper addresses this absence by articulating triangulation and depth-reflexivity as two tools for doing judgemental rationality in empirical research. It draws on the experiences of a diverse team working on an international comparative research project on conversion to Islam in prisons. It demonstrates how epistemic and relational gaps between researchers and research subjects can be bridged by mobilising the ‘laminated’ properties and personal attributes of a diverse research team that factors in attributes that are absent as well as those present. The biographical experiences of the team are analyzed in a variety of intersecting dimensions: faith, ethnicity/ethno-culture, gender, class and professionality. © 2021 The Author(s).

The safety eco-field is based on the ecosemiotic approach which considers environmental safety as a resource sought and chosen by individuals to counter predatory pressure. To test the relative safety of different locations within a landscape, 66 bird feeders (BF) were deployed in a regular 15 × 15 m grid in a rural area, surrounded by shrubs, small trees, hedgerows, and buildings. On each of 48 days in November 2021 and February and March 2022, dried mealworms were placed on each BF and counts of larvae at each BF were made at noon and dusk. The European robin (Erithacus rubecula) and the great tit (Parus major) were the most regular visitors to the BFs. Land cover at each BF was recorded. Bird behaviour at the BFs was noted from direct video recordings of the birds at nine selected BFs, totalling 32 daily sessions in March. The different behaviours of the European robin and the great tit were observable. The safety eco-field changed according to the month and the time of day. The distance of the BF from the woodland edges seemed to be important only in the morning. In the afternoon, BFs that were more distant from the woodland edges received the highest number of visits. Weather conditions were found to influence the number of mealworms removed, but this requires further investigation. A significant relationship between land cover and the number of mealworm larvae removed from the BFs was observed. Within the grid of BF, three regions were distinguishable which were related to land cover in the safety eco-field process. The experimental framework confirms the adequacy, at least for birds that have cryptic predators, to map the landscape as a proxy of safety resource. From the video recordings it was noted that the European robin visits were distributed throughout the day without apparent temporal preferences, while the great tit visits were concentrated in the central part of the day. This result has the limitation of the short period of observation (March) and should be extended to the entire period of the experiment to eventually capture seasonal variation. The experimental evidence obtained confirms that the ecosemiotic-based models of safety eco-field are an efficient approach to explain bird feeding preferences and behaviours. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Bird feeding; Cryptic predators; Ecosemiotics; European robin; Great tit; Safety eco-field,Art and Humanities,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,Article,Scopus

In constructing the framework for this new mode of analysing online, computationally centred performance practice, it draws on discussions of data and the datalogical in Blackman [Blackman, L. 2019.

In looping together these underlying computational happenings with the dramaturgical practices of the performances, I argue that a richer and expanded perspective of online performance practice is afforded–one which opens up the relationships between what we see, feel and experience and the other unseen, but present happenings centred in data exchange and processing within the events in question. © 2021 The Author(s).

During the same time period, the Canadian government, recognising an emergent national-identity crisis in relation to its southern neighbour, invested heavily in original programming on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). This resulted in the popular horror series Nightfall (1980–3), which Danielle Hancock argues presented ‘murder as a Canadian national narrative’ (2018). While CBSRMT occasionally adapted existing stories from other media, the majority of the output for both series were original, written-for-the-air dramas. Embodying Gothic returns of the past upon the present and the effects of transgressive conduct in society, murder is examined as a Gothic trait in episodes of Nightfall and CBSRMT. Radio’s ambiguities and intimacies provoke listeners of these programmes to confront disjunction. The differing worldviews – American masculine nationalism and neoconservatism subverted; Canadian polite and tolerant masculinity turned upside down by a nihilistic rejection of these values – focus Gothic spotlights on each country’s anxieties. © Leslie McMurtry.",Canadian identity; CBS Radio Mystery Theatre; Gothic Radio; murder; Nightfall,Art and Humanities,Edinburgh University Press,Article,Scopus

The market for male skincare products is far more recent and little research has been undertaken on this emerging sector. The practice of men using what was traditionally a product almost solely aimed at women poses some interesting questions about changing gendered identities and practices. Themes emerged from a series of interviews with respondents and key informants from industry about men’s use of skincare products. Based on our findings, we explore the importance of age as a factor in terms of men’s willingness to engage with this form of consumption. Our research showed that men are not comfortable talking with others about their grooming practices. We argue that men’s skincare consumption is an invisible form of consumption. As our findings show, men do not tend to speak openly about whether or not they use moisturiser and other facial skin care products. We concur with Hakim’s (2016) analysis about the pressure for men to continually improve their bodies in order to try to obtain market advantage in a cut-throat neoliberal context. However, with the case of skin care products, men may introspectively gaze in the mirror in contemplation of their improved appearance gained from using facial skincare products but they want this consumption to remain invisible to others. This invisible consumption could be viewed as an indication of wider uncertainty about masculinity in late modernity and the continuing trend for men to feel that there are certain aspects of their life that they feel they should keep to themselves. © The Author(s) 2022.",consumption; identity; invisible consumption; Masculinity; skincare,Art and Humanities,SAGE Publications Ltd,Article,Scopus

MacGill made his reputation, initially, through his poetry that was centred on the hard lives and conditions of the ‘Navvy’ – the itinerant labourers of the British industrial world. He subsequently published two novels that record the conditions of the Irish migrant agricultural and industrial labourers in Scotland, namely The Children of the Dead End and The Rat-Pit, establishing his reputation as a social commentator of the lower reaches of the working class. Several literary commentators such as Jack Mitchell (1982), Seamus Deane (1985), Owen Dudley Edwards (1986), and Terry Phillips (2010), have considered these early works to have a socialist view while others, Lochlinn McGlynn (1944), and Joe Mulholland (1972) have admired the descriptive skills and the realism in his writings. This article considers their points and places in context MacGill’s education in socialism in Greenock and Glasgow around 1909 and highlights examples where his socialist views are manifestly visible outside his novels. Patrick MacGill and Jack London were writers whose early literary works are formed of their experiences in the lower layers of the working class.

Participants heard (Experiment 1) or read (Experiment 2) garden path sentences like “Put the kiwi on the rectangle on the circle”, in which “on the rectangle” could temporarily reflect either a destination of “Put” or modifier of “kiwi”, and they viewed visual arrays with a kiwi on a rectangle and an empty rectangle and circle. Cognitive control was manipulated experimentally by interleaving sentence trials among either mostly incongruent or mostly congruent Stroop trials. Across both experiments, garden path mouse cursor movements to incorrect destinations were reduced when sentence trials were interleaved among mostly incongruent Stroop trials, and in Experiment 2, garden path reading time effects were also reduced in this condition. These results suggest that a high proportion of incongruent trials supports the sustained engagement of cognitive control and causally improves sentence comprehension across (i.e. spoken and written) modalities. © 2024 The Author(s).

The game follows the titular protagonist Omori as it examines such sensitive topics as suicide, grief, death, and depression. Such traumatic events are triggered in several planes of existence—White Space, Headspace, and Black Space—leading to anxiety, regression, and resurfacing trauma. In our article, we examine such representations of trauma with particular attention to the role of environmental design. The planes represent different approaches to memory, trauma, and repression, which Omori and the player navigate in non-linear, recursive paths. We analyze how each space seeks to illuminate and explore aspects of trauma in its respective atmosphere. Through environmental design, OMORI provides players with three distinct experiences with escapism and trauma that are representative of the experiences of trauma victims, ultimately elucidating the psychological phenomenon on a larger scale to de-stigmatize trauma. © The Author(s) 2023.",environmental design; escapism; OMORI; trauma; video games,Art and Humanities,SAGE Publications Inc.,Article,Scopus

It has two main findings—firstly, that the press moved from verbatim council reports in the early part of the century to selective news stories that were designed to maximise news values and commercial revenues. City council meeting reports were re-shaped, re-focused and re-formulated to resemble news stories, often featuring on the front pages. They conformed to journalistic news values such as drama, conflict and personalities and provide evidence of a move to a more news-driven approach to local government reporting. The paper also demonstrates the often-invisible commercial links between some elected representatives and the local press, on whose boards of management they sat. Overall, it provides a challenge to the conventional wisdom that the provincial press interest in municipal issues declined in the twentieth century. © 2022 The Author(s).

In the case of Lake Gropile, results evidenced a more extended tree and shrub cover and high fire activity between 6400 and 2800 cal yr BP, accompanied by reduced soil erosion, which appeared more strongly regulated by climatic conditions. Anthropogenic impact became evident 2800 years ago, when landscape openness, pasturing, and disturbance of soil cover increased and intensified over the last four centuries. In the case of Lake Vinderelu, intensified burning was followed by grazing around 1200–1100 cal yr BP and continued throughout the last millennium. Results also highlight the site-specific effects of land-use on vegetation composition and landscape diversity. For Lake Vinderelu, a combined effect of local burning and grazing in removing shrub cover appear to be the main drivers of changes in landscape diversity and structure. At Lake Gropile, fire was more connected to shrub cover changes while grazing to herbaceous cover diversity. Moderate to low grazing appeared to benefit both subalpine ecosystems, creating rich grassland-shrub mosaic communities, while overgrazing reduced landscape diversity and exacerbated erosion. Our findings document the millennial-scale legacy of land-use practices on the subalpine landscapes in this region. We propose that these semi-natural ecosystems hold important ecological and cultural value, and recommend their maintenance through controlled, low intensity pasturing and/or burning. © The Author(s) 2024.",Carpathians; charcoal; coprophilous fungi; erosion; Holocene; subalpine landscape,Art and Humanities,SAGE Publications Ltd,Article,Scopus

Yet remarkably little detailed attention has been given within the field of British industrial relations or even labour history to the contributory causes, characteristic features, impact and broader implications of this violent dimension of the strikers/scabs relationship within industrial militancy. This paper attempts to fill the gap, focusing on one of the most intense and graphic illustrative time periods, the pre-First World War Labour Revolt between 1910-14. Drawing on an extensive range of secondary literature and new archival material, it explores the way in which working class violence as a form of active collective defence became justified by the way in which it was directly provoked by the employers’ encouragement and/or importation of scab labour, combined with the partisan intervention of police, troops, civil authorities and government as a means of attempting to defeat workers’ struggles. In challenging the legitimacy of public order and state power, such action encouraged a culture of community solidarity and self-defence that embraced many local supporters in the mass picketing against ‘blacklegs’. . © 2022 The Author(s).

Community noise impact is one of the main barriers for the wider adoption of these new vehicles. Within the framework of a perception-driven engineering approach, this paper investigates the relationship between sound quality and first order physical parameters in rotor systems to aid design. Three case studies are considered: (i) contra-rotating versus single rotor systems, (ii) varying blade diameter and thrust in both contra-rotating and single rotor systems, and (iii) varying rotor-rotor axial spacing in contra-rotating systems. The outcomes of a listening experiment, where participants assessed a series of sound stimuli with varying design parameters, allow a better understanding of the annoyance induced by rotor noise. Further to this, a psychoacoustic annoyance model optimised for rotor noise has been formulated. The model includes a novel psychoacoustic function to account for the perceptual effect of impulsiveness. The significance of the proposed model lies in the quantification of the effects of psychoacoustic factors, such as loudness as the dominant factor, and also tonality, high frequency content, temporal fluctuations, and impulsiveness on rotor noise annoyance.  © 2022 Acoustical Society of America.",,Art and Humanities,Acoustical Society of America,Article,Scopus

Although transparent masks and shields (visors) with clear plastic inserts allow speech-reading, they usually create more sound attenuation than opaque masks. Consequently, an iterative process was undertaken to create a better design, and the instructions to make it are published. The experiments showed that lowering the mass of the plastic inserts decreases the high-frequency sound attenuation. A shield with a clear thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) panel had an insertion loss of (2.0 ± 1.1) dB for 1.25-8 kHz, which improves on previous designs that had attenuations of 11.9 dB and above. A cloth mask with a TPU insert was designed and had an insertion loss of (4.6 ± 2.3) dB for 2-8 kHz, which is better than the 9-22 dB reported previously in the literature. The speech intelligibility index was also evaluated. Investigations to improve measurement protocols that use either mannikins or human talkers were undertaken. Manufacturing variability and inconsistency of human speaking were greater sources of experimental error than fitting differences. It was shown that measurements from a mannikin could match those from humans if insertion losses from four human talkers were averaged.  © 2022 Author(s).",,Art and Humanities,Acoustical Society of America,Article,Scopus

This study’s dataset includes a Jane Austen corpus in English compiled by Lancaster University and our self-built diachronic corpus of Austen’s translations in Chinese from 1935 onwards. Our study shows that translations of Austen’s references to food require a dynamicity that bridges time and space and which links cultures and languages; the translations create texts that are novel and original to Chinese audiences. Different strategies have been used by translators to connect food culture in Austen’s era to contemporary China. Translations initially recreated and domesticated original textual references within Chinese culture, while later translations were more contemporary and closer to modern day Western dishes and customs. This study also shows that terminological inconsistency, translation loss, and mistranslation have existed in Chinese translations of Austen since 1935. This research outlines how translators have bridged the temporal distance and cultural space between the epochs of 19th century Britain and modern China in the context of literary depictions of food. © 2022 The Author(s).

Existing research claims that many people with dementia experience a 'shrinking world' whereby the boundaries to their social and physical worlds gradually constrict over time, leading to a loss of control and independence. This paper reports a five-year, international study that investigated the neighbourhood experience of people with dementia and those who care for and support them. We interrogate the notion of a shrinking world and in so doing highlight an absence of attention paid to the agency and actions of people with dementia themselves. The paper draws together a socio-relational and embodied-material approach to question the adequacy of the shrinking world concept as an explanatory framework and to challenge reliance within policy and practice upon notions of place as fixed or stable. We argue instead for the importance of foregrounding 'lived place' and attending to social practices and the networks in which such practices evolve. Our findings have implications for policy and practice, emphasising the need to bolster the agency of people living with dementia as a route to fostering accessible and inclusive neighbourhoods.

Instead of the rather moralizing reporting of the earlier nineteenth century, this journalism used the device of civic shame to pressurize local government into taking action on slums as a matter of public health. It examines the discourses that resulted from civic shame in two newspapers—the Manchester Guardian and the Birmingham Daily Gazette—and challenges the idea that interest in reporting local political matters decreased during this period. Civic shame is shown to work in two ways—offering detailed vignettes of aspects of slum life based on personal observation and showing (some) slum-dwellers as worthy of better living conditions, and blaming the local authority directly for failing to address the problem. In this way, later slum writing sought to appeal directly to the reader not just to impart facts but to stimulate empathy and to develop a desire for action. Such in-depth studies of a particular social issue sought to address the local authorities directly, to apportion blame and to use slum writing as a tool for social action. © The Author(s) 2022.",civic shame; local government; newspapers; public health; slum journalism,Art and Humanities,SAGE Publications Inc.,Article,Scopus

The play breaks down the theatrical technologies of the objects, sounds, movement, characters and audiences involved in Western modern dramatic scripts and staging, and it remakes each through theatre technicity. As it does so, the video moves from being simply a record, to becoming a score, amplifying the script, and the genre moes into skillfully improvised textuality that opens up the unpredictable intercultural metatheatricality of Ōta’s production. © 2023 Lynette Hunter, Peter Lichtenfels and John Zibell.",directing; Intercultural; intermedial; technicity; video score,Art and Humanities,International Association of Theatre Critics,Article,Scopus

Frade C.,THE SUBVERSIVE WEBER: SUBJECTIVATION AND WORLD-CONFRONTATION IN MAX WEBER'S TEACHING,Cosmos and History,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180577708&partnerID=40&md5=d9cc50e630b91009f625f37d8f73e66e,"That there is a subversive Max Weber may go unrecognized even by Marxist scholars otherwise appreciative, if critically, of Weber, to say nothing of mainstream Weber scholarship. That the subversive side of Weber's thought and teaching lies in his figure of subjectivation or stance towards the world, is likely to be met with incredulity, even with a smug smile. Yet, it is precisely this claim what this article seeks to probe by bringing out that stance so as to delineate its pure form and disclose the subject carrying it, an operation which will in addition allow us to see how Weber's social science is both summoned by that subject and specifically suited to study it. Seeking to grasp Weber's thought and teaching from the standpoint of his stance involves a perspective which is consistent with the subjective disposition that Weber demands from himself and his addressees. This is a new approach to Weber's thought which, by prioritising its subjective determinations, is able to demonstrate its fundamental unity, which is not thematic, its consistency, as well as the way in which Weber's theoretical developments and educational efforts spring from his stance and unfold it. Weber's thought is shown to be grounded on an unparalleled disjunctive figure of subjectivation whose two components, held together in pure subjectivity in the mode of tension, are deployed at several crucial levels of Weber's oeuvre. By giving subjectivation its due both structurally and historically vis-à-vis rationalization, the article makes clear that Weber's social and cultural science is not just a science 'of Man', i.e. a humanist science, still less a posthumanist science of human and nonhuman entities in a flattened world, but a science of 'daemonized' humans and rationalized daemons. Is not that social and cultural science, or a variant thereof, what we necessitate today? © 2023 Cosmos Publishing Cooperative.

These Muslim prison officers occupied a precarious occupational cultural space between Us (prison officers) and Them (Muslim prisoners) which presented both risks of exclusion, religious and racial prejudices and opportunities to build bridges between prisoners and staff and to educate, especially in the dimension of religion. The very presence of Muslim prison officers in prisons challenged traditional occupational cultural stereotypes around both prison officers and Muslims. The disproportionately large numbers of Muslim prisoners in Europe and the haphazard way that Muslim prison officers often encounter the profession, suggest both that better training focused upon Islam in prison for existing prison officers is vital and that more directed recruitment of Muslim prison officers is needed. © 2023, The Author(s).",Islam; Muslim prison officers; Muslim prisoners; Occupational culture,Art and Humanities,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,Article,Scopus

If so, the question that arises is what triggered the dissolution of the P.C.I. A conventional wisdom has developed in the literature that puts the dissolution down to the collapse of the communist regimes in central and eastern Europe, effectively removing the P.C.I. as an agent of its own destiny. Yet, an analysis of the P.C.I.’s final decade reveals a different picture, one that still recognizes the role of international events but as a catalyst to an existing programme of dramatic change which began in the late 1980s in response to an existential crisis of the party. The role of the P.C.I. as an independent agency in charge of its own destiny can be reasserted in revisting this critical period in the party’s and Italy’s history. In doing so, it casts new light on the causes of the denouement of the Italian party system in the early 1990s, contextualizing the role of international events in a longer-term analysis of an enveloping crisis of the P.C.I. in its final decade. © 2022 The Author(s).

It is recognised by Historic England as providing information on a variety of structural features within buildings. Infrared thermography (IRT) is an acknowledged retrofit tool for reducing carbon emissions from traditional buildings. The paper explores the potential application of thermography as a tool for detecting infrared images emitted by the internal plaster surface of a timber-framed thatched cottage, dating from the 15th/16th century to 20th century. The thermal irregularities from hidden timber features or structural renovations under the thatch can help improve understanding of the evolution of the building and establish the extent of surviving historical fabrics. The images from IRT investigations conducted under different temperature difference conditions in 2010 and 2012 have been compared against the features exposed when re-thatching the property and upgrading insulation levels in 2019. A follow-up survey was carried out in 2021. Related aspects of the thermal performance of the thatched envelope and the effect on internal temperature distribution have also been investigated. The IRT investigations at Roadside Cottage demonstrated the importance of maintaining sufficiently large temperature differences across thatched roof buildings to permit detection of thermal irregularities arising from hidden timber features. © 2021 The Author(s).

The stereotyped cultural Turk soon populated the London stages, thus moulding a recognisable dramatic type whose brutality and sexual appetite were also combined with political corruption. However, as this contribution seeks to demonstrate, Fulke Greville's Mustapha (1609) and Roger Boyle's Mustapha (1665) instead discuss characters who digress from traditional Orientalist portrayals of Turks whose sexual incontinence parallels with political corruption. In particular, this article engages with intersections between gender studies and Orientalism to investigate how Roxolana, in both plays, transgresses traditional representations of the female Christian-to-Muslim convert, whose lust distracts the Turkish ruler from his political duties. Both playwrights explore Roxolana's active interest in affairs of the Ottoman Court and the unexpected alliance she forms with Hungarian Queen Isabella when she, at the Hungarian Queen's request, protects Isabella's infant son and the Hungarian crown jewels. Their friendship appears to echo gift exchanges between Queen Elizabeth I and Turkish Queen Mother, Safiye Sultan, after the establishment of the Levant Company, which are detailed in various letters exchanged between the two monarchs in 1599. In light of this, I explore how Greville and Boyle could be commenting upon the political turmoil that James I's succession and the Stuart Restoration brought about in England, given that the country was more stable in a religious and political sense under the rule of former monarch Elizabeth I. © 2023 The Author.

We looked for a disproportion across two languages (a cross-language gap) in bilingual children’s knowledge of concrete verbs (e.g., ‘jump’, ‘drink’) and metacognitive verbs (e.g., ‘think’, ‘know’). We also investigated the effects of language exposure and age on bilinguals’ knowledge of both concrete and metacognitive verbs. Methodology: Thirty-nine Polish–English children aged 4;0–7;7 living in the United Kingdom performed vocabulary tasks in both languages: subtasks from Cross-linguistic Lexical Tasks (CLTs) measuring concrete verbs comprehension and production, and metacognitive vocabulary task (METVOC) measuring metacognitive verbs comprehension. Information on children’s cumulative exposure (CE) to each language was collected via parental reports. The amount of metacognitive talk children received in Polish was obtained from parental oral semi-structured narratives. Data and Analysis: Mixed-effects regression models were fitted separately for each task. Findings: A cross-language gap was observed for comprehension of concrete verbs, but metacognitive verbs did not show a cross-language gap. In production of concrete verbs, the English scores showed a steeper increase over age than the Polish scores. CE affected only production of concrete verbs. Correlational analyses showed children’s knowledge of metacognitive verbs in Polish (but not in English) was related to parental metacognitive talk in Polish. Originality: To date, few studies on bilingual children focused on words beyond those referring to imaginable objects and actions, and no study has explored both concrete and metacognitive vocabulary knowledge in bilinguals. Implications: A cross-language gap was observed for bilinguals’ concrete verbs, but metacognitive verbs showed a carry-over effect across languages. The two categories of verbs were also related to different types of linguistic input. While CE affected production of concrete verbs, parental metacognitive talk supported children’s knowledge of metacognitive verbs, but only in the language it was provided in. © The Author(s) 2023.",age; Bilingual children; input; metacognitive words; vocabulary acquisition,,SAGE Publications Ltd,Article,Scopus

In this study, two mask-based algorithms are compared when applied to speech mixed with white Gaussian noise (WGN) at lower SNRs, that is, SNRs from -29 to -5 dB. These comprise an Ideal Binary Mask (IBM) with a Local Criterion (LC) set to 0 dB and an Ideal Ratio Mask (IRM). The performance of three intrusive Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) variants - STOI, STOI+, and Extended Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (ESTOI) - is compared with that of other monaural intelligibility metrics that can be used before and after mask-based processing. The results show that IRMs can be used to obtain near maximal speech intelligibility (>90% for sentence material) even at very low mixture SNRs, while IBMs with LC = 0 provide limited intelligibility gains for SNR < -14 dB. It is also shown that, unlike STOI, STOI+ and ESTOI are suitable metrics for speech mixed with WGN at low SNRs and processed by IBMs with LC = 0 even when speech is high-pass filtered to flatten the spectral tilt before masking.  © 2022 Author(s).",,,Acoustical Society of America,Article,Scopus

To this end, semantic conflict was examined across the entire response time (RT) distribution (as opposed to mean RTs). Three (out of four) reported experiments, along with cross-experimental analyses, revealed that semantic conflict was absent in the participants’ faster responses. This result characterizes Stroop interference as a unitary phenomenon (i.e., driven uniquely by response conflict). When the same participants’ responses were slower, Stroop interference became a composite phenomenon with an additional contribution of semantic conflict that was statistically independent of both response conflict and facilitation. While the present findings allow us to account for the fact that semantic conflict has not been consistently found in past studies, further empirical and theoretical efforts are still needed to explain why exactly it is restricted to longer responses. Indeed, since neither unitary nor composite models can account for this polymorphic nature of Stroop interference on their own, the implications for the current state of theory are outlined. © The Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2024.",Distributional analyses; Response conflict; Response speed; Semantic conflict; Stroop effect,,Springer,Article,Scopus

This research investigated (i) how participant responses change depending on UAS operation, (ii) which broadband metrics are most suitable for representing annoyance and PL, (iii) differences in noise level required to result in equal participant responses to different operations, and (iv) which sound quality metrics (SQMs) are significant for UAS noise perception. Results indicate annoyance and PL responses were greatest for landing operations with flyovers being the least annoying or loud. LAeq, LASmax, and loudness (N5) were the strongest predictors in representing annoyance. Offset analysis predicted small differences in annoyance responses between flyovers and other operations, but also indicated that flyovers would require an increase to LASmax of 3.3 to 6.3 dB compared to other operations to achieve equal PL. Loudness was the most significant SQM, with minor contributions from impulsivity for annoyance and PL when outside, and tonality for PL when indoors. These findings contribute to the understanding of UAS noise perception for the development of metrics and assessment methods accounting for the characteristics of UAS operations. © 2024 Acoustical Society of America.",,,Acoustical Society of America,Article,Scopus

Using the approach formulated by Pound et al. (2005) in synthesising qualitative studies, we identified this continuum of moments as comprising four sequential and interlinked steps: (a) 'creating the moment', defined as the processes and procedures necessary to enable being in the moment to take place - the time necessary for this to occur can range from fleeting to prolonged; (b) 'being in the moment', which refers to the multi-sensory processes involved in a personal or relational interaction and embodied engagement - being in the moment can be sustained through creativity and flow; (c) 'ending the moment', defined as when a specific moment is disengaged - this can be triggered by the person(s) involved consciously or subconsciously, or caused by a distraction in the environment or suchlike; and (d) 'reliving the moment', which refers to the opportunity for the experience(s) involved in 'being in the moment' to be later remembered and shared, however fragmentary, supported or full the recall.

Sant T.; Tabone E.,  Naked data: curating Wikidata as an artistic medium to interpret prehistoric figurines,International Journal of Performance Arts and Digital Media,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169781517&doi=10.1080%2f14794713.2023.2253335&partnerID=40&md5=3458f788cd2371d4cde855db85eff194,"In 2019, Digital Curation Lab Director Toni Sant and the artist Enrique Tabone started collaborating on a research project exploring the visualization of specific data sets through Wikidata for artistic practice. An art installation called Naked Data was developed from this collaboration and exhibited at the Stanley Picker Gallery in Kingson, London, during the DRHA 2022 conference. Through data analysis, employing Wikidata tools, this creative work employs a data set depicting prehistoric female figurines held by Heritage Malta. The artistic research aims to develop a creative workflow model for processing essential information about art collections, museum policies, and ways to engage with cultural heritage through data. This article outlines the key elements involved in this practice-based research work and shares the artistic process involving the visualizing of the scientific data with special attention to the aesthetic qualities afforded by this technological engagement. © 2023 The Author(s).

The research explores the emergence of sculptural qualities as a shaping process between the movement practitioner’s body–mind, movement, technology, and the environment. This video essay demonstrates these emerging relationships through the document(ation) and expands the understanding of live performance and its possibilities within digital environments. This audio-visual essay combines movement practitioners’ living experiences and improvisatory responses with reflective insights into the dynamic and unfolding relationships within the digital environment. Film techniques capture(ing) the improvisatory explorations at that moment, and the transformative potential of performance reveals the fluid, abstract, and temporal unfolding of sculptural qualities that arise from the interplay between improvising bodies, actual and virtual, and motion-capture environments. The audio-visual essay also observes a few initial thoughts on how movement practitioners can access (Range of Coupling ROC and visualisation of digital trace-forms) and activate (T-pose with Stillness) sculptural qualities within digital environments. The accompanying written text expands on the ideas in the video essay and offers contextualising interactions through the post-phenomenological lens and how sculptural qualities are a potential framework within live performances in digital environments. © 2024 The Author(s).

An archaeological survey of the Offerton Hat Works that was carried out between May 2019 and February 2020 in advance of redevelopment has provided a detailed record of one of the best surviving 19th-century hat works in the town. The Offerton Hat Works was hailed as a state-of-the-art ‘model factory’ when established in 1886 by William Battersby, who emerged as one of the leading manufacturers of felt hats. This article summarises the conclusions drawn from the archaeological survey of this important works, with reference to other surveys and excavations of earlier 19th-century hat factories elsewhere in Stockport and in the neighbouring towns of Oldham, Hyde and Denton that together chart the key stages in the transition of hat production in north-west England from a cottage craft to a specialised factory-based industry of international repute. © 2023 The Author(s).

This research seeks to bring greater clarity to the practice of stakeholder engagement in built heritage, so that organisations can manage their stakeholders in ways that meet their strategic goals. This study proposes a novel method to identify stakeholders, a stakeholder preference mapping approach, which will depict their influence on decisions based on a of power-interest scale. Design/methodology/approach: This research posits a stakeholder preference mapping approach. Virtual Stakeholder Groups (VSG) were identified and stakeholder's significance impacts were measured using the RIBA Plan of Work 2013 to determine in-depth consideration of each stakeholder's power and interest against differing stages of a heritage project. Participants were convened through a 5-day workshop, consisting of 20 Malaysian and 19 international participants (80% academics and 20% Malaysian civil servants). The Multi-Attribute Decision Analysis (MADA) technique was then used to demonstrate how stakeholder identification and analysis can be used to help heritage teams meet their mandates. Findings: The research identified eight virtual VSG (Extremist, Expert, Economic, Social, Governance and Tourists) and their scale of power-interest influence at different stages of the heritage management process. The findings reveal varying levels of engagement from each of the different groups of stakeholders at each work stage – with Stage 5 (Construction) being the least engaged. Originality/value: It is anticipated that through stakeholder preference mapping, heritage teams can increase the robustness of their strategies by identifying and effectively managing the important concepts; heritage teams can effectively manage the interface between the many (often competing) demands of differing stakeholders. Using Georgetown as a case study, the research team were able to delineate the interaction and interplay between the various stakeholders in the complex decision-making processes for a UNESCO heritage site. Applying the RIBA 2013 Plan of Work as a framework to the heritage management process enables a formalised mapping approach to the process. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Georgetown; Malaysia; Multi-attribute decision analysis; Stakeholder analysis; Virtual stakeholder groups; World heritage,,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,Article,Scopus
