Yottabytes (YB) of information are being produced in the IoT environs because of the ever-increasing utilization capacity of the Internet. Since sensitive information, as well as privacy problems, always seem to be an unsolved problem, even with best-in-class in-formation governance standards, it is difficult to bolster defensive security capabilities. Secure data sharing across disparate systems is made possible by blockchain technology, which operates on a decentralized computing paradigm. In the ever-changing IoT environments, blockchain technology provides irreversibility (immutability) usage across a wide range of services and use cases. Therefore, blockchain technology can be leveraged to securely hold private information, even in the dynamicity context of the IoT. However, as the rate of change in IoT networks accelerates, every potential weak point in the system is exposed, making it more challenging to keep sensitive data se-cure. In this study, we adopted a Multi-level Blockchain-based Secured Framework (M-BSF) to provide multi-level protection for sensitive data in the face of threats to IoT-based networking systems. The envisioned M-BSF framework incorporates edge-level, fog-level, and cloud-level security. At edge- and fog-level security, baby kyber and scaling kyber cryptosystems are applied to ensure data preservation. Kyber is a cryptosystem scheme that adopts public-key encryption and private-key decryption processes. Each block of the blockchain uses the cloud-based Argon-2di hashing method for cloud-level data storage, providing the highest level of confidentiality. Argon-2di is a stable hashing algorithm that uses a hybrid approach to access the memory that relied on dependent and independent memory features. Based on the attack-resistant rate (> 96%), computational cost (in time), and other main metrics, the proposed M-BSF security architecture appears to be an acceptable alternative to the current methodologies. © 2023, The Author(s).",Attack; Computation; Cryptosystem; Data protection; Decryption; Encryption; Hashing; Multiple securities; Overheads; Resistant,Computer science,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,Article,Scopus

However, implementing these technologies comes with certain obstacles, such as the limited availability of energy resources and processing power. Consequently, there is a need for energy-efficient and intelligent load-balancing models, particularly in healthcare, where real-time applications generate large volumes of data. This paper proposes a novel, energy-aware artificial intelligence (AI)-based load balancing model that employs the Chaotic Horse Ride Optimization Algorithm (CHROA) and big data analytics (BDA) for cloud-enabled IoT environments. The CHROA technique enhances the optimization capacity of the Horse Ride Optimization Algorithm (HROA) using chaotic principles. The proposed CHROA model balances the load, optimizes available energy resources using AI techniques, and is evaluated using various metrics. Experimental results show that the CHROA model outperforms existing models. For instance, while the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), and Whale Defense Algorithm with Firefly Algorithm (WD-FA) techniques attain average throughputs of 58.247 Kbps, 59.957 Kbps, and 60.819 Kbps, respectively, the CHROA model achieves an average throughput of 70.122 Kbps. The proposed CHROA-based model presents an innovative approach to intelligent load balancing and energy optimization in cloud-enabled IoT environments. The results highlight its potential to address critical challenges and contribute to developing efficient and sustainable IoT/IoE solutions. © 2023 by the authors.",big data analytics; cloud computing; clustering; healthcare; Internet of Everything; Internet of Things; load balancing,Computer science,MDPI,Article,Scopus

Flash crowds are large, sudden, yet legitimate influxes of user requests that constitute a critical problem because of their potential economic damage. For cloud providers, resource estimation is challenging, while distributing workload and sustaining performance. To alleviate flash crowds and resource failure problems, we propose a novel weight assignment load balancing algorithm that combines five carefully selected server metrics to efficiently distribute the workload of three-tier web applications among virtual machines. We experimentally characterised, using a private cloud running OpenStack, the load distribution ability of our proposed novel algorithm, as well as a baseline algorithm and round-robin algorithm. We compared the performance of the three algorithms by simulating resource failures and flash crowds, while carefully measuring response times. Our experimental results show that our approach improves average response times by 12.5% when compared to the baseline algorithm and 22.3% when compared to the round-robin algorithm in the flash crowds’ situation. In addition, average response time was improved by 20.7% when compared to the baseline algorithm and 21.4% when compared to the round-robin algorithm in resource failure situations. These experiments show that our novel algorithm is more resilient to fluctuating loads and resource failures than baseline algorithms. © 2023, The Author(s).",Cloud computing; Load balancing; Three-tier applications; Weight assignment,Computer science,Springer,Article,Scopus

A qualitative study,Journal of Enterprise Information Management,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163719772&doi=10.1108%2fJEIM-08-2022-0282&partnerID=40&md5=d903ef38cc8cc762af2b5c37417f0d17,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore how big data analytics (BDA) as a potential information technology (IT) innovation can facilitate the retail logistics supply chain (SC) from the perspective of outbound logistics operations in the United Kingdom. The authors' goal was to better understand how BDA can be integrated to streamline SCs and logistical networks by using the technology, organisational and environmental model. Design/methodology/approach: The authors applied existing theoretical foundations for theory building based on semi-structured interviews with 15 SC and logistics managers. Findings: The perceived benefits of using BDA in outbound retail logistics comprised the strongest predictor amongst technological, organisational and environmental issues, followed by top management support (TMS). A framework was proposed for the adoption of BDA in retail logistics. Contextual concepts from previous literature have helped us understand how environmental changes impact BDA decision-making, as such: (i) SC maturity levels and connectivity affect BDA utilisation, (ii) connected SCs improve data accessibility and information exchange, (iii) the benefits of BDAs also affect adoption and (iv) outsourcing complex tasks to experts allows companies to focus on core businesses instead of investing in IT infrastructure. Research limitations/implications: Outside the key findings listed, this study shows that there is no one-size-fits-it-all approach for use within all organisational settings. The proposed framework reveals that the perceived benefit of BDA is non-transferrable and requires top-level management support for successful implementation. Originality/value: The existing literature focusses on the approaches to applying BDA in SC and logistics but fails to present a deep dive into retail outbound logistics activity. This study addresses the “how” and proposes a social-inclusive framework for a technology-enabled topic. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Big data analytics; Outbound logistics; Retail supply chain management; Supply chain analytics; TOE framework,Computer science,Emerald Publishing,Article,Scopus

Without robust security measures, a massive volume of confidential and classified data could be exposed to vulnerabilities through which hackers could do various illicit acts. As a result, improved network security mechanisms that can analyse network traffic and detect malicious traffic in real-time are required. In this paper, a novel optimized machine learning image-based IoT malware detection method is proposed using visual representation (i.e., images) of the network traffic. In this method, the ant colony optimizer (ACO)-based feature selection method was proposed to get a minimum number of features while improving the support vector machines (SVMs) classifier’s results (i.e., the malware detection results). Further, the PSO algorithm tuned the SVM parameters of the different kernel functions. Using a public dataset, the experimental results showed that the SVM linear function kernel is the best with an accuracy of 95.56%, recall of 96.43%, precision of 94.12%, and F1_score of 95.26%. Comparing with the literature, it was concluded that bio-inspired techniques, i.e., ACO and PSO, could be used to build an effective and lightweight machine-learning-based malware detection system for the IoT environment. © 2023 by the authors.",ACO; bio-inspired optimization; IoT; machine learning; malware detection; PSO; SVM,Computer science,MDPI,Article,Scopus

Changes to these activities can be accurately quantified using combined measurement. Using activPAL3 and self-reports to collect activity data, the study aimed to quantify changes that occurred in physical activity and sedentary behavior between prelockdown and lockdown. The study also sought to determine changes in indoor and outdoor stepping. Methods: Using activPAL3, four participants recorded physical activity data prelockdown and during lockdown restrictions (February–June 2020). Single events (sitting, standing, stepping, lying) were recorded and analyzed by the CREA algorithm using an event-based approach. The analysis focused on step count, sedentary time, and lying (in bed) time; median and interquartile range were calculated. Daily steps classified as taking place indoors and outdoors were calculated separately. Results: 33 prelockdown and 92 in-lockdown days of valid data were captured. Median daily step count across all participants reduced by 14.8% (from 5,828 prelockdown to 4,963 in-lockdown), while sedentary and lying time increased by 4% and 8%, respectively (sedentary: 9.98–10.30 hr; lying: 9.33–10.05 hr). Individual variations were observed in hours spent sedentary (001: 8.44–8.66, 002: 7.41–8.66, 003: 11.97–10.59, 004: 6.29–7.94, and lying (001: 9.69–9.49, 002: 11.46–11.66, 003: 7.63–9.34, 004: 9.7–11.12) pre-and in-lockdown. Discrepancies in self-report versus algorithm classification of indoor/outdoor stepping were observed for three participants. Conclusion: The study quantitively showed lockdown restrictions negatively impacted physical activity and sedentary behavior; two variables closely linked to health outcomes. This has important implications for public health policies to help develop targeted interventions and mandates that encourage additional physical activity and lower sedentary behavior. © 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.",activity monitor; lockdown; physical activity; sedentary,Computer science,Human Kinetics Publishers Inc.,Article,Scopus

Its timely detection is a profound challenge for the security of networks and systems. The situation is even more challenging for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) of developing countries where limited resources and investment in deploying foreign security controls and development of indigenous security solutions are big hurdles. A robust, yet cost-effective network intrusion detection system is required to secure traditional and Internet of Things (IoT) networks to confront such escalating security challenges in SMEs. In the present research, a novel hybrid ensemble model using random forest-recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE) method is proposed to increase the predictive performance of intrusion detection system (IDS). Compared to the deep learning paradigm, the proposed machine learning ensemble method could yield the state-of-the-art results with lower computational cost and less training time. The evaluation of the proposed ensemble machine leaning model shows 99%, 98.53% and 99.9% overall accuracy for NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets, respectively. The results show that the proposed ensemble method successfully optimizes the performance of intrusion detection systems.

Self-supervised learning can be divided into two main categories: Generative and Contrastive methods. While Generative methods mainly focus on reconstructing data, Contrastive learning methods refine data representations by leveraging the contrast between each sample and its augmented version. However, existing Contrastive learning methods for anomalous sound detection often have two main problems. The first one is that they mostly rely on simple augmentation techniques, such as time or frequency masking, which may introduce biases due to the limited diversity of real-world sounds and noises encountered in practical scenarios (e.g., factory noises combined with machine sounds). The second issue is dimension collapsing, which leads to learning a feature space with limited representation. To address the first shortcoming, we suggest a diffusion-based data augmentation method that employs ChatGPT and AudioLDM. Also, to address the second concern, we put forward a two-stage self-supervised model. In the first stage, we introduce a novel approach that combines Contrastive learning and masked autoencoders to pre-train on the MIMII and ToyADMOS2 datasets. This combination allows our model to capture both global and local features, leading to a more comprehensive representation of the data. In the second stage, we refine the audio representations for each machine ID by employing supervised Contrastive learning to fine-tune the pre-trained model. This process enhances the relationship between audio features originating from the same machine ID. Experiments show that our method outperforms most of the state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods. Our suggested model achieves an average AUC and pAUC of 94.39% and 87.93% on the DCASE 2020 Challenge Task2 dataset, respectively. © 2023 by the authors.",anomalous sound detection; Contrastive learning; diffusion-based data augmentation; masked autoencoders; Variance—Covariance Regularization,Computer science,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Scopus

In 2017, Zhou and Feng introduced a deep random forest called gcForest that involves several layers of Random Forest-based classifiers. Although gcForest has outperformed several benchmark algorithms on specific datasets in terms of classification accuracy and model complexity, its input features do not ensure better performance when going deeply through layer-by-layer architecture. We address this limitation by introducing a deep ensemble model with a novel feature generation module. Unlike gcForest where the original features are concatenated to the outputs of classifiers to generate the input features for the subsequent layer, we integrate weights on the classifiers’ outputs as augmented features to grow the deep model. The usage of weights in the feature generation process can adjust the input data of each layer, leading the better results for the deep model. We encode the weights using variable-length encoding and develop a variable-length Particle Swarm Optimization method to search for the optimal values of the weights by maximizing the classification accuracy on the validation data. Experiments on a number of UCI datasets confirm the benefit of the proposed method compared to some well-known benchmark algorithms. © 2023 The Author(s)",Deep learning; Ensemble method; Ensemble of classifiers; Feature generation; Multiple classifiers; Random forest,Computer science,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

The types and characteristics of these devices vary depending on the industry 4.0 and have rapidly increased recently, especially in smart homes. These gadgets can expose users to serious cyber dangers because of a variety of computing constraints and vulnerabilities in the security-by-design concept. The smart home network testbed setup presented in this study is used to evaluate and validate the protection of the smart cyber-physical system. The context-aware threat intelligence and response model identifies the states of the aligned smart devices to distinguish between real-world typical and attack scenarios. It then dynamically writes specific rules for protection against potential cyber threats. The context-aware model is trained on IoT Research and Innovation Lab - Smart Home System (IRIL-SHS) testbed dataset. The labeled dataset is utilized to create a random forest model, which is subsequently used to train and test the context-aware threat intelligence SHS model's effectiveness and performance. Finally, the model's logic is used to gain rules to be included in Suricata signatures and the firewall rulesets for the response system. Significant values of the measuring parameters were found in the results.

Cable vibration will react on the end-effector, causing attitude deviation of the end-effector. The main objective of this study is to accurately model axially moving flexible cables and characterize the dynamic behaviors of associated compliant CDPRs. Firstly, a model for transverse vibration of the axially moving length-variable cable is developed. On this basis, an original nonlinear dynamic model of the CDPRs able to capture the vibration of the cables and the dynamics of the end-effector is proposed. Secondly, the frequency-amplitude relationship of the CDPR is obtained. Moreover, the significance of the excitation effect caused by the axially moving length-variable cables is demonstrated, by comparing the results with and without excitation effect at different frequencies. It turns out that, as the oscillation frequency of the end-effector increases, the end-effector and cables exhibit the dynamics process from steady state to unstable large-amplitude vibration and finally to stable small-amplitude vibration. This indicates that the dynamics of the CDPR exhibit non-linear characteristics, due to the influence of flexible cables. Finally, the proposed dynamic model of compliant CDPRs is validated by experiments performed in the laboratory. © The Author(s), 2023.

Attackers usually exploit vulnerabilities in software which may not have adequately considered security features during the development process. Agile methods have the potential to increase productivity and ensure faster delivery of software, although they tend to neglect non-functional requirements such as security. The implementation of government policies, such as the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) Act 2019, impacts the security activities carried out by agile teams. Despite its significance, there is a paucity of research on security issues especially in the Agile Software Development (ASD) domain. To address this gap, a grounded theory study was conducted with 15 agile software practitioners in Nigeria. Based on our analysis of the interview transcripts, we developed a grounded theory of the security challenges confronting agile practitioners. The four challenges identified were (a) a lack of collaboration between security and agile teams; (b) the tendency to use foreign software hosting companies; (c) a poor cybersecurity culture; and (d) the high cost of building secure agile software. We used these challenges to identify gaps within the existing secure ASD and found a lack of indigenous software hosting companies in Nigeria. Our study also revealed tensions between the Nigerian regulatory environment and agile software developers' compliance. While practitioners acknowledged the government's efforts, there were concerns about the practicality of implementing such legislation.

This model is related to three types of movement modes of the ankle movement, without axis offset, which can cover the ankle joint movements. The inverse and forward position/kinematics results analysis of the mechanism is established based on the closed-loop vector method and using the optimization of particle groups algorithm. Four groups of position solutions of the mechanism are obtained. The kinematics simulation is analyzed using ADAMS software. The variations of the velocity and acceleration of all limbs are stable, without any sudden changes, which can effectively ensure the safety and comfort of the ankle model end-user. The dexterity of the mechanism is analyzed based on the transport function, and the results indicate that the mechanism has an excellent transfer performance in yielding the structure parameters. Finally, the rehabilitation evaluation is conducted according to the three types of movement modes of the ankle joint. The results show that this ankle rehabilitation mechanism can provide a superior rehabilitation function. © 2023 by the authors.",(2-CRS+PU)&R hybrid mechanism; ankle rehabilitation; dexterity; kinematics; rehabilitation effect evaluation,Computer science,MDPI,Article,Scopus

A crucial challenge for developing a MIS robot is the kinematic design of the remote center-of-motion (RCM) mechanism. In this paper, a class of spatial RCM mechanism is analyzed. They are obtained by generating virtual parallelograms. The main process is to construct a line that passes through a fixed point under the mechanical constraint. The axis of the surgical tool is then constrained to parallel with that line. Hence, due to the geometrical feature of the parallel lines, the axis of the surgical tool will always pass through a fixed point, i.e., the RCM point. Due to the specially designed structure, the fixed point does not need to be physically belonging to the mechanism. The geometrical analysis method is employed to obtain the closed-form solution of the forward kinematics of the proposed mechanisms. Due to the high load capacity of parallel mechanism, the robots based on the proposed RCM mechanisms have promising applications as an external positioner to be used in robotic single-port surgeries.  © The Author(s), 2022.

We believe that this outstanding performance benefits a lot from the unique biological features of the hand musculoskeletal system. In Part I of this article, a bio-inspired anthropomorphic robotic finger was developed, based on which two human-finger-like biomechanical advantages were elaborately investigated, including the anisotropic variable stiffness associated with the ligamentous joints and the enlarged feasible force space associated with the reticular extensor mechanisms. In Part II, the fingertip force-velocity characteristics resulting from the flexible tendon sheath are studied. It indicates that the fingertip force-velocity workspace can be greatly augmented owing to the self-adaptive morphing of the flexible tendon sheaths, showing the average improvement of 41.2% theoretically and 117.5% experimentally compared with the results of 2 mm, 4 mm, and 6 mm size rigid tendon sheaths. Grasping tests and comparisons are then conducted with four three-fingered robotic hands (one with the robotic finger proposed in Part I, one with hinge joints, one with linear extensors, and one with rigid tendon sheaths) and the human hands of six subjects to handle various objects on flat, rough, and soft surfaces. The results show that the novel bio-inspired design in this research could improve the grasping success rates of the robotic hand. Compared with the grasping test results from the robotic hand with the bio-inspired robotic finger proposed in Part I, the overall grasping performance of a robotic hand with hinge joints, linear extensors, and rigid tendon sheaths decreases by 10%, 6%, and 17%, respectively. The results have also shown that with the embedded biomechanical advantages, even without complex control and sensory systems, the robotic fingers can achieve very comparable performance to human fingers in the grasping demonstrations presented, indicating average 94% of the success rate achieved by the human fingers. Successfully demonstrating 14 of 16 grasp types in the Cutkoskey taxonomy further shows the human-finger-like grasping capability of the proposed robotic fingers.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",Bio-inspired robotic finger; flexible tendon sheath; force-velocity workspace; grasping and manipulation; robotic hand,Computer science,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Scopus

However, in recent years, smart infrastructure, including cyber-physical industries, has witnessed a severe disruption of operation due to privilege escalation, exploitation of misconfigurations, firmware hijacking, malicious node injection, botnets, and other malware infiltrations. The proposed agentless module for Wazuh security information and event management (SIEM) solution contributes to securing small- to large-scale IoT networks of industry 4.0. An agentless module is implemented by vigilantly examining the IoT device traffic without installing any agent or software on the endpoints. In the proposed research scheme, a module sniffs the network traffic of IoT devices captured from the gateway and passes it to a machine learning model for initial detection and prediction. The output of the ML model is embedded in the JSON log format and passed through the Wazuh agent to the Wazuh server where a decoder is added that decodes the network traffic logs. For event monitoring in Wazuh, industrial protocols are also thoroughly analyzed, and the feature set is determined. These features are used to write rules which are tested on the SWaT dataset, utilizing a common industrial protocol (CIP) for communication. Custom and dynamic rules are written at the Wazuh end to generate alerts to respond to any anomaly detected by the machine learning (ML) model or in the protocols used. Finally, in case of any event or an attack is detected, the alerts are fired on the Wazuh dashboard. This agentless SIEM solution has practical implications for the security of the industrial control systems of industry 4.0. © 2023 by the authors.",agentless; cybersecurity; industrial IoT; machine learning; SIEM solution; SWaT,Computer science,MDPI,Article,Scopus

It enables the diagnosis of various diseases through the interpretation of medical images. In addition, telemedicine, including teleradiology, has been a crucial impact on remote medical consultation, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with the increasing reliance on digital medical images comes the risk of digital media attacks that can compromise the authenticity and ownership of these images. Therefore, it is crucial to develop reliable and secure methods to authenticate these images that are in NIfTI image format. The proposed method in this research involves meticulously integrating a watermark into the slice of the NIfTI image. The Slantlet transform allows modification during insertion, while the Hessenberg matrix decomposition is applied to the LL subband, which retains the most energy of the image. The Affine transform scrambles the watermark before embedding it in the slice. The hybrid combination of these functions has outperformed previous methods, with good trade-offs between security, imperceptibility, and robustness. The performance measures used, such as NC, PSNR, SNR, and SSIM, indicate good results, with PSNR ranging from 60 to 61 dB, image quality index, and NC all close to one. Furthermore, the simulation results have been tested against image processing threats, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method in ensuring the authenticity and ownership of NIfTI images. Thus, the proposed method in this research provides a reliable and secure solution for the authentication of NIfTI images, which can have significant implications in the healthcare industry. © 2023 Basheer et al.",Affine transform; Hessenberg matrix decomposition; LWT; NIfTI medical image; s Watermarking,Computer science,PeerJ Inc.,Article,Scopus

Thus, binary decision tree (BDT) and genetic algorithm (GA) methods are combined using a wrapping technique. The BDT algorithm is used to classify data in a tree structure, while the GA is used to identify the best attribute combinations from a set of possible combinations, referred to as generations. The study seeks to address the problem of overfitting that may occur when classifying large datasets by reducing the number of attributes used in classification. Using the GA, the number of selected attributes is minimized, reducing the risk of overfitting. The algorithm produces many attribute sets that are classified using the BDT algorithm and are assigned a fitness number based on their accuracy. The fittest set of attributes, or chromosomes, as well as the BDTs, are then selected for further analysis. The training process uses the data of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region but derived from three different cultivars. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this innovative approach in defining certain ingredients and weights of wine’s origin. © 2023 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; data mining; decision making; decision trees; feature selection; GA wrapper; genetic algorithm; machine learning; supervised learning,Computer science,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Scopus

The proposed conceptual model was created to empower future perspectives of the metaverse system. Even though the metaverses system was just recently launched, few attempts have been made to evaluate its impact on the educational sector. This paper attempted to determine the impact of metaverse system by providing a conceptual model that encompasses innovativeness, context awareness, perceived enjoyment, ubiquity, complexity, and value. The information was gathered using an online questionnaire completed by 953 people. The findings indicate that an innovative academic environment can influence teachers’ and students’ attitudes toward new technology. Understanding how the metaverse system functions as an innovative educational tool can influence students’ views regarding the use of new technology, assisting higher education institutions in developing regulations that enhance the learning process. As a result, the study discovered that the moderating impact of’ innovativeness is critical since it contributes to the pervasiveness of users’ perceptions of adopting new technology. The findings show that inventiveness is important in determining the metaverse system’s effectiveness. However, apparent ubiquity appears to have a less effective function in promoting the use of the metaverse system. The factors of context-awareness, perceived complexity and perceived enjoyment possess a substantial impact on the metaverse system’s adoption. Researchers have gained some insight into how university leaders can use current findings to spread awareness about the metaverse system in the educational environment by organizing seminars and workshops, offering incentives for teachers to use it, and allowing experts to assist teachers in better understanding the system’s benefits. © 2023 by the authors.",education technology; innovativeness; mestaverse adoption; perceived complexity; perceived enjoyment; perceived ubiquity; perceived value,Computer science,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Scopus

As the landscape of modern communication standards continues to expand, there is a mounting inclination towards efficient ECC technologies, such as Low-Density Parity-Check codes (LDPCs). Distinguished by their near-capacity performance and low computational complexity, LDPCs are increasingly utilized in the successful encoding and decoding of data. This study undertakes an exploration of recent advancements in LDPC research, encompassing the analysis of decoding algorithms, architectures, applications, simulations, real-world implementations, and complexities across various hardware platforms. The central research problem addressed within this work is the identification of the most efficacious LDPC decoder implementation, with an emphasis placed on Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. From the outcomes of this study, the Min-Sum algorithm emerged as the favored choice for LDPC decoding, particularly within FPGA implementations. The selection of this algorithm is attributable to its simplicity and implementation feasibility, thus directly addressing the posed research problem. The inherent simplicity of the Min-Sum algorithm's structure renders it a practical choice for real-world applications. Further, its proficiency in error correction and compatibility with FPGA hardware underscore its potential for augmenting the reliability of data transmission in communication systems. The findings of this study advocate for the Min-Sum algorithm as a valuable asset in LDPC decoding, notably within FPGA implementations. This positions it as a promising candidate for optimizing data communication systems.

However, their accuracy is often affected by hysteresis which poses a significant challenge during operation. This paper introduces a novel approach that employs a backpropagation (BP) neural network to address the hysteresis nonlinearity in conductive fiber-based tactile sensors. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, four sensor units were designed. These sensor units underwent force sequences to collect corresponding output resistance. A backpropagation network was trained using these sequences, thereby correcting the resistance values. The training process exhibited excellent convergence, effectively adjusting the network’s parameters to minimize the error between predicted and actual resistance values. As a result, the trained BP network accurately predicted the output resistances. Several validation experiments were conducted to highlight the primary contribution of this research. The proposed method reduced the maximum hysteresis error from 24.2% of the sensor’s full-scale output to 13.5%. This improvement established the approach as a promising solution for enhancing the accuracy of soft tactile sensors based on piezoresistive materials. By effectively mitigating hysteresis nonlinearity, the capabilities of soft tactile sensors in various applications can be enhanced. These sensors become more reliable and more efficient tools for the measurement and control of force, particularly in the fields of soft robotics and wearable technology. Consequently, their widespread applications extend to robotics, medical devices, consumer electronics, and gaming. Though the complete elimination of hysteresis in tactile sensors may not be feasible, the proposed method effectively modifies the hysteresis nonlinearity, leading to improved sensor output accuracy. © 2023 by the authors.",backpropagation neural network; conductive fabric; hysteresis; tactile sensor,Computer science,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Scopus

The sole purpose of this paper is to conglomerate the fundamentals of Blockchain, AI (Artificial Intelligence) and DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) encryption into one proposed scheme, KryptosChain, which is capable of providing a secure information exchange between a sender and his intended receiver. The scheme firstly suggests a DNA-based Huffman coding scheme, which alternatively allocates purines—Adenine (A) and Guanine (G), and pyrimidines—Thymine (T) and Cytosine (C) values, while following the complementary rule to higher and lower branches of the resultant Huffman tree. Inculcation of DNA concepts makes the Huffman coding scheme eight times stronger than the traditional counterpart based on binary—0 and 1 values. After the ciphertext is obtained, the proposed methodology next provides a Blockchain-inspired message exchange scheme that achieves all the principles of security and proves to be immune to common cryptographic attacks even without the deployment of any smart contract, or possessing any cryptocurrency or arriving at any consensus. Lastly, different classifiers were engaged to check the intrusion detection capability of KryptosChain on the NSL-KDD dataset and AI fundamentals. The detailed analysis of the proposed KryptosChain validates its capacity to fulfill its security goals and stands immune to cryptographic attacks. The intrusion possibility curbing concludes that the J84 classifier provides the highest accuracy of 95.84% among several others as discussed in the paper. © 2023 by the authors.",blockchain technology; DNA encryption; information exchange; intrusion detection system; secure communication,Computer science,MDPI,Article,Scopus

To date, a wearable system capable of measuring in-shoe multi-directional stresses for out-of-lab analysis has been elusive. The lack of an insole system capable of measuring plantar pressure and shear hinders the development of an effective foot ulcer prevention solution that could be potentially used in a daily living environment. This study reports the development of a first-of-its-kind sensorised insole system and its evaluation in laboratory settings and on human participants, indicating its potential as a wearable technology to be used in real-world applications. Laboratory evaluation revealed that the linearity error and accuracy error of the sensorised insole system were up to 3% and 5%, respectively. When evaluated on a healthy participant, change in footwear resulted in approximately 20%, 75% and 82% change in pressure, medial–lateral and anterior–posterior shear stress, respectively. When evaluated on diabetic participants, no notable difference in peak plantar pressure, as a result of wearing the sensorised insole, was measured. The preliminary results showed that the performance of the sensorised insole system is comparable to previously reported research devices. The system has adequate sensitivity to assist footwear assessment relevant to foot ulcer prevention and is safe to use for people with diabetes.

Jump height (JH) is the main outcome variable reported for this purpose; however, it is sensitive to alterations in movement strategy, which may act to mask JH and, therefore, mask any presence of NMF. Acute reductions in body mass (BM) during match play could also lead to the maintenance of JH, but this is yet to be explored. This study sought to explore soccer-match-induced alterations to JH, movement strategy, and BM to inform future variable selection for the study of acute NMF. Fourteen male English National League soccer players performed three CMJs on a dual-force plate system immediately before and after a competitive soccer match. Differences in jump height were non-significant and trivial (p = 0.924, g = 0.03) before and after soccer match play, but there was a large post-match decrease in BM (g = 1.66). Furthermore, moderate decreases in jump momentum (g = 0.56) and countermovement depth (g = 0.72) were noted. As JH was determined by the take-off velocity, reduced BM could have augmented it (less mass to accelerate); however, reduced countermovement depth seemingly counteracted this (less distance to attain velocity). It may, therefore, be beneficial to report these variables when monitoring acute NMF via the CMJ. © 2023 by the authors.",countermovement jump; football; force plate; force platform; neuromuscular fatigue,Computer science,MDPI,Article,Scopus

By applying a pair of antagonistic MISAs to a joint, it is capable of achieving joint stiffness adjustment and joint torque adaptation. The joint with MISAs can achieve a wide range of joint stiffness, about 520% of that obtained by linear stiffness actuators, i.e. LSSA (share the same allowable elastic force and elastic travel with MISA). A stiffness range of 0-121.86 Nm and deflection of ± 8.9° can be achieved when MISAs are applied to a joint with a moment arm of 180 mm. The MISA achieves a high Power/Volume ratio of 345.02 × 103 W/m3. The application of the MISA in the development of a biomimetic robotic arm is also presented, with the investigation of joint stability and output torque analyse under various joint stiffnesses. Two experiments show that joints with MISAs can emulate the state of human joints when the muscles are tensed and relaxed.

We then use this approach to characterise the maximum step count over a range of window durations within a population of older adults to identify a preferred duration over which to measure the maximum step count. We found that while almost all individuals (97%) undertook at least one instance of continuous stepping longer than two minutes, a sizeable minority of individuals (31%) had no periods of continuous stepping longer than six minutes. We suggest that the maximum step count measured over a six-minute period may be too sensitive to the adults’ lack of opportunity to undertake prolonged periods of stepping, and a two-minute window could provide a more representative measure of physical performance. © 2023 by the authors.",accelerometer; activPAL; iData; physical activity; stepping,Computer science,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Scopus

This could have an impact on its legacy and on sustainability in society in the long term. This research examined the role of social media in spreading misinformation during the COVID-19 outbreak in Jordan. A cross-sectional design questionnaire (350 responses) was used. The results revealed that social media played a key role in updating users with COVID-19 information. However, the availability of misinformation remained highly prevalent. Respondents revealed that they relied heavily on social media for information gathering and knowledge sharing about COVID-19 updates. The role of behavioural intention remained prominent and highly significant for these two reasons. Their behavioural intention was linked to the sharing of unchecked information, suggesting that online information in Jordan needs greater regulation to reduce the spread of misinformation. © 2023 by the authors.",communication; COVID-19; fake news; Jordan; knowledge sharing; misinformation; social media,Computer science,MDPI,Article,Scopus

To enhance the bond between layers, adhesive materials, such as tack coats, are used. The tack coat itself is a bituminous material, which is applied on an existing relatively non-absorbent surface to ensure a strong bond between the old and newly paved layer. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of various types of tack coat materials on interlayer bond strength and to determine the optimal application rate for each type. The tack coat types used in this paper were RC-70, RC-250, and CSS-1h. Both laboratory-prepared and field-constructed hot mix asphalt concrete pavements using the tack coats were tested for the binding strength between the layers. A direct shear test was used for the testing. The results obtained from the study showed that the optimum application rate for RC-70 was 0.1 L/m2, and for RC-250, it was 0.2 L/m2, while the optimum application rate for CSS-1h was 0.1 L/m2. From the field test, the optimum application rate of the RC-250 tack coat was 0.1 L/m2. © 2023 by the authors.",bond strength; direct shear test; interlayer bond; pavement; tack coat,Computer science,MDPI,Article,Scopus

Resource allocation and quality of service (QoS) optimization are critical challenges in MEC systems due to the large number of devices and applications involved. This results in poor latency with minimum throughput and energy consumption as well as a high delay rate. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach for resource allocation and QoS optimization in MEC using IoT by combining the hybrid kernel random Forest (HKRF) and ensemble support vector machine (ESVM) algorithms with crossover-based hunter–prey optimization (CHPO). The HKRF algorithm uses decision trees and kernel functions to capture the complex relationships between input features and output labels. The ESVM algorithm combines multiple SVM classifiers to improve the classification accuracy and robustness. The CHPO algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that mimics the hunting behavior of predators and prey in nature. The proposed approach aims to optimize the parameters of the HKRF and ESVM algorithms and allocate resources to different applications running on the MEC network to improve the QoS metrics such as latency, throughput, and energy efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms other algorithms in terms of QoS metrics and resource allocation efficiency. The throughput and the energy consumption attained by our proposed approach are 595 mbit/s and 9.4 mJ, respectively. © 2023 by the authors.",crossover-based hunter-prey optimization; ensemble support vector machine; hybrid kernel random forest; internet of things; quality of service; resource allocation,Computer science,MDPI,Article,Scopus

A significant proportion of these losses are expected to occur from the out-of-distribution risks which arise from situations outside the AV's training experience. Traditional vehicle insurance products (for human-driven vehicles) rely on large data sets of drivers' background and historical incidents. However, the lack of such datasets for AVs makes it imperative to exploit the ability to deploy AVs in simulated environments. In this paper, the data collected by deploying Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) in simulated environments is used to develop models to answer two questions: (1) how risky a road Section is for an AV to drive? and (2) how does the risk profile vary with different (SAE levels) of ADSs? A simulation pipeline was built on the CARLA (Car Learning to Act): an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. The environment was specified using parameters such as weather, lighting, traffic density, traffic flow, no. of lanes, etc. A metric - risk factor was defined as a combination of harsh accelerations/braking, inverse Time to Collision, and inverse Time Headway to capture the crashes and near-crashes. To assess the difference between ADSs, two ADSs: OpenPilot (Level 2/3) and Pylot (Level 4) were implemented in the simulator. The results (from data and model predictions) show that the trends in the relation between the environment features and risk factor for an AV are similar to those observed for human drivers (e.g., risk increases with traffic flow). The models also showed that junctions were a risk hot-spot for both ADSs. The feature importance of the model revealed that the Level 2/3 ADS is more sensitive to no. of lanes and the Level 4 ADS is sensitive to traffic flow. Such differences in feature importance provide valuable insights into the risk characteristics of different ADSs. In the future, this base model will be extended to include other features (other than the environment), e.g., take over requests, and also address the deficiencies of the current simulation data in terms of insensitivity to weather and lighting. © 2013 IEEE.",Autonomous vehicle; insurance; risk modelling; simulation; traffic density; traffic flow,Computer science,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Scopus

This critical sector is spearheading the establishment of technical security measures to mitigate information security risks, yet employee behavioral influence remains an ongoing challenge in assuring information security. Existing studies of this domain primarily focus on employee behavior reshaping through multiple psychological theories. However, these studies ignore how these critical infrastructures implement information security. Most such infrastructures follow the International Society of Automation (ISA)-95 levels of automation and implement information security controls in line with these levels. This research paper proposed a theoretical framework to enhance information security policy compliance (ISPC) at level 4 to level 2 automation level in O&G organizations. To support the hypotheses, data were collected from 13 Malaysian O&G organizations. A total of 254 O&G employees participated in the survey and the structural equation modeling technique was used for data analysis. The study confirmed that ISA-95-based organizational governance factors and social bonding could enhance ISPC in O&G organizations. However, risk assessment and involvement factors have shown less support to the notion. For information systems practitioners, this study has shown how to enhance ISPC in O&G organizations through ISA-95-based organizational governance and social bonding. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE.",ISA-95; Oil and gas organizations; Organizational governance; Social bonding,Computer science,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Article,Scopus

IoT routing is the basis for the efficient operation of the perception-layer network. As a popular type of machine learning, reinforcement learning techniques have gained significant attention due to their successful application in the field of network communication. In the traditional Routing Protocol for low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL) protocol, to solve the fairness of control message transmission between IoT terminals, a fair broadcast suppression mechanism, or Drizzle algorithm, is usually used, but the Drizzle algorithm cannot allocate priority. Moreover, the Drizzle algorithm keeps changing its redundant constant k value but never converges to the optimal value of k. To address this problem, this paper uses a combination based on reinforcement learning (RL) and trickle timer. This paper proposes an RL Intelligent Adaptive Trickle-Timer Algorithm (RLATT) for routing optimization of the IoT awareness layer. RLATT has triple-optimized the trickle timer algorithm. To verify the algorithm's effectiveness, the simulation is carried out on Contiki operating system and compared with the standard trickling timer and Drizzle algorithm. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm performs better in terms of packet delivery ratio (PDR), power consumption, network convergence time, and total control cost ratio. © 2023 The Authors",Automation; IoT routing; Optimization; Reinforcement learning; Trickle timer; Wireless sensor networks,Computer science,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

Among the various operations, routing is still recognized as a resource-intensive activity. As a result, designing an energy-efficient routing system for WBAN is critical. The existing routing algorithms focus more on energy efficiency than security. However, security attacks will lead to more energy consumption, which will reduce overall network performance. To handle the issues of reliability, energy efficiency, and security in WBAN, a new cluster-based secure routing protocol called the Secure Optimal Path-Routing (SOPR) protocol has been proposed in this paper. This proposed algorithm provides security by identifying and avoiding black-hole attacks on one side, and by sending data packets in encrypted form on the other side to strengthen communication security in WBANs. The main advantages of implementing the proposed protocol include improved overall network performance by increasing the packet-delivery ratio and reducing attack-detection overheads, detection time, energy consumption, and delay. © 2023 by the authors.",black-hole attack; energy efficiency; routing; wireless body-area network,Computer science,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Scopus

During a single testing session, the HD force plates were placed directly atop two adjacent Advanced Mechanical Technology Inc. in-ground force plates (the “gold standard”) to simultaneously collect vertical ground reaction forces produced by 20 participants (27 ± 6 years, 85 ± 14 kg, 176.5 ± 9.23 cm) during the countermovement jump (CMJ) and drop jump (DJ) tests (1000 Hz). Agreement between force plate systems was determined via ordinary least products regression using bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. No bias was present between the two force plate systems for any of the CMJ and DJ variables, except DJ peak braking force (proportional bias) and DJ peak braking power (fixed and proportional bias). The HD system may be considered a valid alternative to the industry gold standard for assessing vertical jumps because fixed or proportional bias was identified for none of the CMJ variables (n = 17) and only 2 out of 18 DJ variables. © 2023 by the authors.",accuracy; agreement; concurrent validity; force–time; hardware; vertical jump; wireless dual force plate system,Computer science,MDPI,Article,Scopus

The rapid adoption of IoT-powered smart cities is faced by a number of security and privacy challenges that hindered their application in areas such as critical infrastructure. One of the most crucial elements of any smart city is safety. Without the right safeguards, bad actors can quickly exploit weak systems to access networks or sensitive data. Security issues are a big worry for smart cities in addition to safety issues. Smart cities become easy targets for attackers attempting to steal data or disrupt services if they are not adequately protected against cyberthreats like malware or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Therefore, in order to safeguard their systems from potential threats, businesses must employ strong security protocols including encryption, authentication, and access control measures. In order to ensure that their network traffic remains secure, organizations should implement powerful network firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS). This article proposes a blockchain-supported hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) to provide privacy and security for smart city users and systems. Blockchain is used to provide trust, and CNN enabled with KPCA is used for classifying threats. The proposed solution comprises three steps, preprocessing, feature selection, and classification. The standard features of the datasets used are converted to a numeric format during the preprocessing stage, and the result is sent to KPCA for feature extraction. Feature extraction reduces the dimensionality of relevant features before it passes the resulting dataset to the CNN to classify and detect malicious activities. Two prominent datasets namely ToN-IoT and BoT-IoT were used to measure the performance of this anticipated method compared to its best rivals in the literature. Experimental evaluation results show an improved performance in terms of threat prediction accuracy, and hence, increased security, privacy, and maintainability of IoT-enabled smart cities. © 2023 SCPE.",68T05; Blockchain; Convolutional neural network; Deep Learning; Internet of Things; Intrusion detection; Principal Component Analysis; Privacy and security; Sensor technology AMS subject classifications. 68M12,Computer science,West University of Timisoara,Article,Scopus

As a part of this study, the reliability of predicting the usage of water in the present and future is investigated in order to develop an effective prediction model to communicate demand. In order to improve prediction, we develop a prediction model and share the updated model with nearby farmers. In order to forecast the irrigation requirements, the recommended model utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT), k-nearest neighbours (KNN), cloud storage, long short-term memory (LSTM), and adaptive network fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) techniques. By collecting real-time environmental data, KNN identifies the closest water requirement from the roots and its surrounding. In order to predict short-term requirements, ANFIS is used. To transfer the new requirements for better prediction, transfer learning is used. Time-series-data updates are predicted using LSTM for future forecasting, and the integrated model is shared with other farmers using cloud environments to enhance forecasting and analysis. For implementation, a period of nine to ten months of data was collected from February to December 2021, and banana tree was used to implement the planned strategy. Four farms, with measurements, were considered at varying intervals to determine the minimum and maximum irrigation needs. The requirements of farms were collected over time and compared to the predictions. Future requirements at 8, 16, 24, 32, and 48 h were also anticipated. The results indicated were compared to manual water pouring, and, thus, the entire crop used less water, making our prediction model a real-world option for irrigation. The prediction model was evaluated using R2, MSLE and the average initial prediction value of R2 was 0.945. After using transfer learning, the prediction of the model of Farm-2, 3 and 4 were 0.951, 0.958 and 0.967, respectively. © 2023 by the authors.",ANFIS; IoT; LSTM; soil sensing; sustainable irrigation system; transfer learning,Computer science,MDPI,Article,Scopus

Besides capturing these data streams and reporting the monitoring information, there is significant potential for adopting deep learning to identify valuable insights for predictive preventive maintenance. One specific class of applications involves using Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) to predict faults happening in the near future. However, despite their remarkable performance, LSTMs can be very opaque. This paper deals with this issue by applying Learning Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (LFCMs) for developing simplified auxiliary models that can provide greater transparency. An LSTM model for predicting faults of industrial bearings based on readings from vibration sensors is developed to evaluate the idea. An LFCM is then used to imitate the performance of the baseline LSTM model. Through static and dynamic analyses, we demonstrate that LFCM can highlight (i) which members in a sequence of readings contribute to the prediction result and (ii) which values could be controlled to prevent possible faults. Moreover, we compare LFCM with state-of-the-art methods reported in the literature, including decision trees and SHAP values. The experiments show that LFCM offers some advantages over these methods. Moreover, LFCM, by conducting a what-if analysis, could provide more information about the black-box model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time LFCMs have been used to simplify a deep learning model to offer greater explainability. © 2023 The Authors.

This paper presents a unified framework for modeling and predicting discharge flow rate using an evolutionary-based polynomial regression technique. EPR (Evolutionary Polynomial Regression) is a data-driven method based on evolutionary computing to search for polynomial structures representing a system. The input parameters in the modeling procedure included the sheet pile height, upstream water head, and the hydraulic conductivity anisotropy ratio. Due to ever-increasing demand for water, a widely held view on predicting and controlling the available water behind reservoirs, dams, barrages, and weirs is of vital importance. To this end, the sheer novelty of the current study has been worn off through the development of a comprehensive model to predict the flow rate considering the most effective variables in the seepage issue. To the best of our knowledge, the research conducted in the literature has yet to cover the whole seepage problem using a comprehensive database extracted by numerical methods; thus, a comprehensive finite-element-based artificial database including 1000 data lines was created using the Scaled Boundary Finite Element Method (SBFEM) by simulating seepage beneath sheet plies covering a considerably wide range of seepage-related real-world values. The database was then employed to develop and validate the EPR flow rate prediction model. Data were divided into training (used for creating the models) and testing (for validating the developed models) data based on a statistical process. The procedure for preparing the data and developing and validating the models is presented in detail in this paper. The main advantage of the proposed models over a conventional and neural network and most GP (Genetic Programming)-based constitutive models is that they provide the optimum structure for the material constitutive model representation as well as its parameters, directly from raw experimental (or field) data. EPR can learn nonlinear and complex material behavior without any prior assumptions on the constitutive relationships. The proposed algorithm captures and transparently presents relationships between contributing parameters in polynomial expressions providing the user with a clear insight into the problem. EPR-based model predictions demonstrated an excellent agreement with the unseen simulated data used for validating the developed model. A parametric study on the presented models was conducted to investigate the effects of the contributing parameters on model predictions and the consistency of the parameter relationships with the database. Results of the parametric study showed that the effects of variations in the contributing parameters on EPR predictions are in line with the expected behavior. The merits and advantages of the proposed technique are discussed in the paper. © 2023, The Author(s).",Data mining; Evolutionary computation; Seepage flow rate; Sheet piles/cut-off walls,Computer science,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Article,Scopus

As SNs are not directly connected to the BS, multihop data transmissions through other SNs are required to reach the BS, which leads to congestion and additional energy consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm called Congestion, Delay, Energy-aware Intelligent Routing (CDEIR) using the BUG algorithm. The CDEIR approach identifies congested nodes using a Directed Spanning Tree and avoids traffic through them by paving an alternate path. This approach minimizes delay and optimizes energy consumption while avoiding congestion, all within a short computational time.

The effects of magnetic induction are induced because the Reynolds number is not small. The sheet is traveling with a temperature and velocity that are inversely related to how far away from the steady edge it is from the plane in which it is traveling. We also imposed external velocity (Formula presented.) in the boundary. The necessary major equations are made dimensionless by the local non-similarity transformation and become a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations after being transformed from non-linear partial differential equations. The subsequent numerical solution of the arisen non-dimensional boundary value problem utilizes a sixth-order Runge–Kutta integration scheme and Nachtsheim–Swigert shooting iterative technique. A good correlation is seen when the solutions are compared to previously published results from the literature. Through the use of graphical representation, the physical impacts of the fluid parameters on speed, induced magnetic field, and temperature distribution are carried out. Furthermore, the distributions for skin friction coefficient and local Nusselt number are also studied for different scenarios. The skin friction coefficient and local Nusselt number are observed to increase with greater values of the temperature exponent parameter and velocity exponent parameter. However, as heat radiation increases, the local Nusselt number decreases even though temperatures are noticeably higher.

This research presents a scalable dynamic behavioral authentication model utilizing keystroke typing patterns. The model is constructed around five key components: human-computer interface devices, encryption of behavioral data, consideration of the authenticator's emotional state, incorporation of cross-platform features, and proposed implementation solutions. It addresses potential typing errors and employs data encryption for behavioral data, achieving a harmonious blend of usability and security by leveraging keyboard dynamics. This is accomplished through the implementation of a web-based authentication system that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for advanced feature engineering. Keystroke typing patterns were gathered from participants and subsequently employed to evaluate the system's keystroke timing verification, login ID verification, and error handling capabilities. The web-based system uniquely identifies users by merging their username-password (UN-PW) credentials with their keyboard typing patterns, all while securely storing the keystroke data. Given the achievement of a 100% accuracy rate, the proposed Behavioral Dynamics Authentication Model (BDA) introduces future researchers to five scalable constructs. These constructs offer an optimal combination, tailored to the device and context, for maximizing effectiveness. This achievement underscores its potential applications in the realm of authentication. © (2023), (Science and Information Organization).

As these VR worlds become more popular, it is no surprise for them to be used as avenues for adverse and criminal purposes, where unknowing users could be targets for malicious activities. To the best of our knowledge, there is no literature providing insight into the kinds of artefacts that could be left behind on users' systems after the use of such web-based VR worlds. To close this gap, we provide foundations for digital forensic investigations on web-based VR worlds using Decentraland as a case study. We performed experiments on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge web browsers. Findings revealed that details of the real-world user as well as their avatar activities within the VR world could be recovered from the web browser data files on disk, in memory, and in network traffic which could be used to reconstruct the chain of activities.  © 1979-2012 IEEE.",,Computer science,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Scopus

Various services, such as quality of service (QoS) for smart cyber security management from the industrial domain, are complicated for us. It is challenging to select the optimal malicious nodes by taking into account QoS criteria, including information communication, and network coverage regions. Numerous constrained evolutionary optimization strategies are known to address these problems. This study proposes a broader definition of differential evolution (DE) that uses a quick adaptation strategy and an optimization-based design. It combines DE with a unique mutation approach to broaden the range of viable answers. This research also suggests a novel fitness function for energy harvesting in IoT-based applications. Both on the IIoT-service architecture and in IIoT-based applications, the suggested method is assessed. The outcomes are then contrasted using state-of-the-art algorithms.

In these industrial systems, the industrial internet of things (IIoT) significantly improves system efficiency, scalability, ease of control, and monitoring. These benefits have been achieved at the cost of greater security risks, thus making the system vulnerable to cyberattacks. Historically, industrial networks and systems lacked security features like authentication and encryption due to intended isolation over the Internet. Lately, remote access to these IIoT systems has made an attempt of holistic security alarmingly critical. In this research paper, a threat modeling framework for smart cyber–physical system (CPS) is proposed to get insight of the potential security risks. To carry out this research, the smart firefighting use case based on the MITRE ATT&CK matrix was investigated. The matrix analysis provided structure for attacks detection and mitigation, while system requirement collection (SRC) was applied to gather generic assets’ information related to hardware, software and network. With the help of SRC and MITRE ATT&CK, a threat list for the smart firefighting system was generated. Conclusively, the generated threat list was mapped on the national institute of standards and technology (NIST) security and privacy controls. The results show that these mapped controls can be well-utilized for protection and mitigation of threats in smart firefighting system. In future, critical cyber–physical systems can be modeled upon use case specific threats and can be secured by utilizing the presented framework. © 2023 The Author(s)",Cyber–Physical System (CPS); IIoT; IoT; NIST controls; Smart firefighting system; Smart industrial system; Threat modeling,Computer science,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

The focus on (potentially) biomedical news articles allows the quantity of biomedically valid information (as extracted by biomedical relation extraction) to be included in the list of explored features. Aside from forming part of a systematic correlation exploration, the features – ranging from the semantic relations through readability measures to the article’s digital content – are used within a number of machine learning classifier and regression algorithms. Unsurprisingly, the results support that for more complex articles (as determined by a readability measure) more sophisticated syntactic structure may be expected. A weak correlation is found with information within an article suggesting that other factors, such as numbers of videos, have a notable impact on the popularity of a news article. The best popularity prediction performance is obtained using a random forest machine learning algorithm, and the feature describing the quantity of biomedical information is in the top 3 most important features in almost a third of the experiments performed.

As such, it represents a new but little-examined frontier in the study of sexuality, technology, and identity formation. Using a qualitative sociological approach, this exploratory study identifies Grindr tourism practices and their consequences for gay tourism, tourist-local relations, and digitally mediated social life. With Tel Aviv as the research site, Grindr tourism practices were analyzed using 19 in-depth interviews and six audio diaries. The concept of embedded learning is used to understand the communication that results from contemporary mobile media-integrated tourism. Grindr tourism practices are viewed as mutually beneficial by tourists, locals, and immigrants. Findings indicate that Grindr tourism contributes to tourists’ embedded learning about travel destinations, immigrants’ acclimation and friendship networks, and locals’ self-ascribed cosmopolitan, multicultural identities. The research also uncovered wider issues affecting sexuality, communication, migration movements, ethnicity, and the economic bodies that support large-scale tourism. Specifically, Grindr is used as a tool to arrange independent, mobile, non-institutionalized travel that serves as an alternative to LGBT + tourism industry institutions. Not only is Grindr tourism indicative of shifting travel practices, but it also reflects dating apps’ overarching tendency toward the convergence of multiple social functions into one platform. © The Author(s) 2023.",dating app; gay tourism; gender and sexuality; Grindr; LGBT +,Computer science,SAGE Publications Ltd,Article,Scopus

Early detection is crucial to prevent vision loss, but current manual scanning methods are expensive, time-consuming, and require specialized expertise. This study presents a novel approach to Glaucoma detection using the Enhanced Grey Wolf Optimized Support Vector Machine (EGWO-SVM) method. The proposed method involves preprocessing steps such as removing image noise using the adaptive median filter (AMF) and feature extraction using the previously processed speeded-up robust feature (SURF), histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and Global features. The enhanced Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) technique is then employed with SVM for classification. To evaluate the proposed method, we used the online retinal images for glaucoma analysis (ORIGA) database, and it achieved high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates of 94%, 92%, and 92%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other current algorithms in detecting the presence or absence of Glaucoma.

The integration of IoT networks with the metaverse will enable more meaningful connections between the 'real' and 'virtual' worlds, allowing for real-time data analysis, access, and processing. However, these metaverse-IoT networks will face numerous security and privacy threats. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) offer an effective means of early detection for such attacks. Nevertheless, the metaverse generates substantial volumes of data due to its interactive nature and the multitude of user interactions within virtual environments, posing a computational challenge for building an intrusion detection system. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an innovative intrusion detection system model based on deep learning. This model aims to detect most attacks targeting metaverse-IoT communications and combines two techniques: KPCA (Kernel Principal Component Analysis which was used for attack feature extraction and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks for attack recognition and classification. The efficiency of this proposed IDS model is assessed using two widely recognized benchmark datasets, BoT-IoT and ToN-IoT, which contain various IoT attacks potentially targeting IoT communications. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed IDS model in identifying 12 classes of attacks relevant to metaverse-IoT, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.8% and a False Negative Rate FNR less than 0.2. Furthermore, when compared with other models in the literature, our IDS model demonstrates superior performance in attack detection accuracy. © 2023 The Author(s)",CNN; Convolutional neural network; Internet of Things; Intrusion detection; IoT attacks; Kernel principal component analysis; Metaverse; Security and privacy,Computer science,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

The aim of this study was to examine the associations between physical activity volume (average acceleration), intensity (intensity gradient) and cardiometabolic health when assessed by a thigh-worn and wrist-worn accelerometer. A sample of 659 office workers wore an Axivity AX3 on the non-dominant wrist and an activPAL3 micro on the right thigh concurrently for 24 h a day for 8 days. An average acceleration (proxy for physical activity volume) and intensity gradient (intensity distribution) were calculated from both devices using the open-source raw accelerometer processing software GGIR. Clustered cardiometabolic risk (CMR) was calculated using markers of cardiometabolic health, including waist circumference, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, mean arterial pressure and fasting glucose. Linear regression analysis assessed the associations between physical activity volume and intensity gradient with cardiometabolic health. Physical activity volume derived from the thigh-worn activPAL and the wrist-worn Axivity were beneficially associated with CMR and the majority of individual health markers, but associations only remained significant after adjusting for physical activity intensity in the thigh-worn activPAL. Physical activity intensity was associated with CMR score and individual health markers when derived from the wrist-worn Axivity, and these associations were independent of volume. Associations between cardiometabolic health and physical activity volume were similarly captured by the thigh-worn activPAL and the wrist-worn Axivity. However, only the wrist-worn Axivity captured aspects of the intensity distribution associated with cardiometabolic health. This may relate to the reduced range of accelerations detected by the thigh-worn activPAL. © 2023 by the authors.",accelerometry; activPAL; Axivity; GGIR; measurement,Computer science,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Scopus

Motivated by exploring the fluid dynamics of such processes, a mathematical model is developed for chemically reactive Cu–H2O magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) nanofluid swirl coating flow on a revolving vertical electrically insulated cone adjacent to a porous medium under a radial static magnetic field. Heat and mass transfer is included and Dufour and Soret cross-diffusion effects are also incorporated in the model. Thermal and solutal buoyancy forces are additionally included. To simulate chemical reaction of the diffusing species encountered in manufacturing processes, a higher-order chemical reaction formulation is also featured. Via suitable scaling transformations, the governing nonlinear coupled partial differential conservation equations and associated boundary conditions are reformulated as a nonlinear ordinary differential boundary value problem. MATLAB-based shooting quadrature with a Runge–Kutta method is deployed to solve the emerging system. Concentration, temperature and velocity variations for various nondimensional flow parameters have been visualized and analyzed. In addition, key wall characteristics, i.e., radial and circumferential skin friction, Nusselt number and Sherwood number, have also been computed. Validation with earlier studies is also included. The simulations indicate that when compared to a lower-order chemical reaction, a higher-order chemical reaction allows a greater rate of heat and mass transfer at the cone surface. Increasing Dufour (diffuso-thermal) and Soret numbers generally reduces radial and circumferential skin friction and also Nusselt number, whereas it elevates the Sherwood number. Both skin friction components are also suppressed with increasing Richardson number. Strong deceleration in the tangential and circumferential velocity components is induced with greater magnetic field. © World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.",Dufour and Soret effects; Higher-order chemical reaction; magnetic nanofluid; porous medium; Sherwood number; swirl nanocoating manufacturing; vertical cone,Computer science,World Scientific,Article,Scopus

Personalisation is proposed as an indirect antecedent of deep eWOM providing behaviour mediated by hedonic and utilitarian value perceptions and personal identification. Design/methodology/approach: Based on social-exchange theory, the conceptual model links the study antecedents to deep eWOM providing behaviour. The conceptual model was validated through a multi-country study. A large sample of m-commerce users in the UK (n = 505), India (n = 422) and Vietnam (n = 618) were contacted to collect the data. Data were analysed through structural equations modelling procedure with invariance analysis conducted to ensure that the results from the three samples could be compared. The authors also conducted post-hoc analysis to explore the mediation paths between variables. Findings: The study finds support to the conceptual model across the samples from the three countries. Personalisation is found to increase value perceptions – both utilitarian and hedonic – and personal identification which leads to “deep” eWOM providing behaviour across all the three countries. The serial mediation also provides comparable results across the three countries. Originality/value: The study contributes to the understanding of deep eWOM providing behaviour – a construct with high practical relevance which has however not been explored sufficiently in current literature.

In this article, a bioinspired anthropomorphic robotic finger is first proposed, which embeds human finger musculoskeletal features in the design. Based on this design, three human-finger-like biomechanical advantages are systematically investigated and embodied in the bioinspired robotic finger. This article for the first time derives, presents, and experimentally verifies the mathematical models for the variable stiffness of finger ligamentous joints and self-adaptive morphing mechanism of finger flexible tendon sheaths, and validates and compares the influence of the reticular and linear extensor morphologies on fingertip feasible forces in three-dimensional (3-D) space. In this Part I of the article, two of the biomechanical properties, i.e., joint stiffness generated by the ligamentous joint of the finger, and fingertip feasible force space influenced by the reticular extensor mechanism are systematically investigated through theoretical modeling and experimental verification. Correspondingly, two biomechanical advantages were found, i.e., the ligamentous joint of the finger could provide anisotropic variable joint stiffness, enhancing the adaptivity, dexterity, and stability of fingers; and a reticular extensor mechanism could enlarge the fingertip feasible force space in 3-D space by 30.9% theoretically and 146.4% experimentally on average compared with the linear extensor, contributing to enrich force conditions during interactions. The third biomechanical advantage, i.e., fingertip force-velocity workspace can be augmented through the flexible tendon sheath, and grasping tests for a robotic hand designed with the aforementioned advantages are presented in Part II of this article.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",Bioinspired robotic finger; extensor mechanism; feasible force space; robotic hand; soft-rigid-hybrid design; variable joint stiffness,Computer science,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Scopus

Mixed data were gathered, using a questionnaire exploring teachers’ perceptions of their relationships with their students, alongside semi-structured, exploratory interviews with teachers and alienated pupils. A critical realist grounded theory design was employed, identifying closeness and conflict as causative mechanisms contributing new insights into the phenomena of school alienation. This approach allowed for data to be triangulated, constantly compared, and used to verify findings. This study discovered some pupils experience a more pronounced subset of alienation, where teachers perceive their relationships with such pupils as being less close and more conflictual when compared to their peers. It also identified that these pupils place an emphasis on negative experiences early into the formation of relationships with their teachers. Such experiences are viewed as critical incidents which are difficult to forget by alienated pupils. A diagram summarising this mechanism is presented, and the paper concludes with some professional strategies for teachers to help repair the relationship and reduce pupils’ feelings of alienation. © 2023 by the authors.",alienation; critical incidents; critical realism; grounded theory; pupil–teacher relationships; social psychology of education,Computer science,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Scopus

Several surveys in this large field have proved how social media involvement has made a trackless network using machine learning techniques through web applications and Android modes using interoperability. This article proposes an improved social media sentiment analytics technique to predict the individual state of mind of social media users and the ability of users to resist profound effects. The proposed estimation function tracks the counts of the aversion and satisfaction levels of each inter- and intra-linked expression. It tracks down more than one ontologically linked activity from different social media platforms with a high average success rate of 99.71%. The accuracy of the proposed solution is 97% satisfactory, which could be effectively considered in various industrial solutions such as emo-robot building, patient analysis and activity tracking, elderly care, and so on. © 2023 by the authors.",information system; machine learning; sentiment analysis; social media analytics,Computer science,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Scopus

It is also important for the telecommunication industry to obtain a high profit. Thus, the challenge is to predict the churn percentage of customers with higher accuracy without comprising the profit. In this study, various types of learning strategies are investigated to address this challenge and build a churn predication model. Ensemble learning techniques (Adaboost, random forest (RF), extreme randomized tree (ERT), xgboost (XGB), gradient boosting (GBM), and bagging and stacking), traditional classification techniques (logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), and k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and artificial neural network (ANN)), and the deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) technique have been tested to select the best model for building a customer churn prediction model. The evaluation of the proposed models was conducted using two pubic datasets: Southeast Asian telecom industry, and American telecom market. On both of the datasets, CNN and ANN returned better results than the other techniques. The accuracy obtained on the first dataset using CNN was 99% and using ANN was 98%, and on the second dataset it was 98% and 99%, respectively. © 2023 by the authors.",churn prediction; customer relationship management; data analytics; telecommunication industry,Computer science,MDPI,Article,Scopus

As far as dementia in older people goes, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is by far the most prevalent form. For over fifty years, medical and exclusion criteria were used to diagnose AD, with an accuracy of only 85 per cent. This did not allow for a correct diagnosis, which could be validated only through postmortem examination. Diagnosis of AD can be sped up, and the course of the disease can be predicted by applying machine learning (ML) techniques to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques. Dementia in specific seniors could be predicted using data from AD screenings and ML classifiers. Classifier performance for AD subjects can be enhanced by including demographic information from the MRI and the patient’s preexisting conditions. In this article, we have used the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. In addition, we proposed a framework for the AD/non-AD classification of dementia patients using longitudinal brain MRI features and Deep Belief Network (DBN) trained with the Mayfly Optimization Algorithm (MOA). An IoT-enabled portable MR imaging device is used to capture real-time patient MR images and identify anomalies in MRI scans to detect and classify AD. Our experiments validate that the predictive power of all models is greatly enhanced by including early information about comorbidities and medication characteristics. The random forest model outclasses other models in terms of precision. This research is the first to examine how AD forecasting can benefit from using multimodal time-series data. The ability to distinguish between healthy and diseased patients is demonstrated by the DBN-MOA accuracy of 97.456%, f-Score of 93.187 %, recall of 95.789 % and precision of 94.621% achieved by the proposed technique. The experimental results of this research demonstrate the efficacy, superiority, and applicability of the DBN-MOA algorithm developed for the purpose of AD diagnosis. © 2023 by the authors.",alzheimer; DBN; Deep Belief Network; disease detection; healthcare; IoT; machine learning,Computer science,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Scopus

The arms are assumed to be able to retract at a steady speed to half their length, and then at a later time in the motion extend at the same steady speed back to their original length. It is important in the field of medical biology, because this motion could enable a micro-robotic device to swim within the arterial and cellular fluid to perform medical biological procedures such as surgery or drug delivery. The method used was the development of a theoretical mathematical model in low Reynolds number Stokes flow, that takes the mathematical expression for steady motion of a sphere, and from this obtains the motion for three spheres by assuming leading order interactions between the spheres. This gives an interaction matrix from which the important results of the study are obtained which are exact mathematical expressions for the mean distance travelled, mean drift velocity and energy efficiency of the motion. These are that the mean distance travelled is 3a0ln(9/8), the mean drift velocity is (3a0/2A)ln(9/8), and the energy efficiency of the motion is 9a02/(4A2)[ln(9/8)]2, where a0 is the sphere radius and A is the arm length. The conclusions to be drawn from the results are that the most efficient design has the largest ratio for sphere radius in relation to arm length. The novelty of the work is that it gives exact mathematical expressions for distance travelled, velocity and energy efficiency not given previously in the literature. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Microscopic robot swimmer; Oseen tensor; Stokes flow,Computer science,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Scopus

The deployment and implementation of the IoT paradigm in industrial settings lead to the architectural changes of Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) plus the countless connectivity of industrial systems. This resulted in what is referred to as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which removes the barrier of connecting IACS to isolated conventional ICT platforms. In recent times, the IoT has started hacking our personal lives and not only our world, thus creating a platform for impending IoT cyberattacks. The widespread use of the IoT has created a rich platform for possible IoT cyberattacks. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been driven solutions to secure wireless communication in IIoT-based systems, and their use in solving various cybersecurity challenges. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel intrusion detection model based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Bat algorithm (BA) for feature selection, and the Random Forest (RF) classifier for the classification of malicious behaviors in IIoT-based network traffic. An IIoT-based cybersecurity dataset, WUSTL-IIOT-2021 Dataset, was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model using accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score. The results of the two feature selection were compared to identify the most promising one. The results were compared with other recent state-of-the-art ML and multiobjective algorithms, and the results showed better performance. The RF along with BA classifier had proved to be the best classifier. © 2023 Tarek Gaber et al.",,Computer science,Hindawi Limited,Article,Scopus

The study addresses the existing challenges and gaps in decision-making processes within Saudi organizations, highlighting the need for proper systems and identifying the loopholes that hinder informed decision making. The research aims to answer two key research questions: (1) how do decision makers ensure the accuracy of their decisions? and (2) what is the proper process to govern and control decision outcomes? To achieve these objectives, the research adopts a qualitative research approach, including an intensive literature review and interviews with decision makers in the Saudi health sector. The proposed IDSF fills the gap in the existing literature by providing a comprehensive and adaptable framework for decision making in Saudi organizations. The framework encompasses structured, semi-structured, and unstructured decisions, ensuring a thorough approach to informed decision making. It emphasizes the importance of integrating non-digital sources of information into the decision-making process, as well as considering factors that impact decision quality and accuracy. The study’s methodology involves data collection through interviews with decision makers, as well as the use of visualization tools to present and evaluate the results. The analysis of the collected data highlights the deficiencies in current decision-making practices and supports the development of the IDSF. The research findings demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing approaches, offering improved accuracy and efficiency in decision making. Overall, this research paper contributes to the state of the art by introducing a novel IDSF specifically designed for the Saudi health sector. © 2023 by the authors.",analysis; decision support; framework; information systems; stakeholders,Computer science,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Scopus

Currently, phishing attacks and threats are being handled effectively through the use of the latest phishing email detection solutions. Most current phishing detection systems assume phishing attacks to be in English, though attacks in other languages are growing. In particular, Arabic is a widely used language and therefore represents a vulnerable target. However, there is a significant shortage of corpora that can be used to develop Arabic phishing detection systems. This article presents the development of a new English-Arabic parallel phishing email corpus that has been developed from the anti-phishing share task text (IWSPA-AP 2018). The email content was to be translated, and the task had been allotted to 10 volunteers who had a university background and were English and Arabic language experts. To evaluate the effectiveness of the new corpus, we develop phishing email detection models using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and Multilayer Perceptron using 1,258 emails in Arabic and English that have equal ratios of legitimate and phishing emails. The experimental findings show that the accuracy reaches 96.82% for the Arabic dataset and 94.63% for the emails in English, providing some assurance of the potential value of the parallel corpus developed. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

In the past twenty years, the volume of digitised wildlife sound available has massively increased, and automatic classification through deep learning now shows strong results. However, bioacoustics is not a single task but a vast range of small-scale tasks (such as individual ID, call type, emotional indication) with wide variety in data characteristics, and most bioacoustic tasks do not come with strongly-labelled training data. The standard paradigm of supervised learning, focussed on a single large-scale dataset and/or a generic pre-trained algorithm, is insufficient. In this work we recast bioacoustic sound event detection within the AI framework of few-shot learning. We adapt this framework to sound event detection, such that a system can be given the annotated start/end times of as few as 5 events, and can then detect events in long-duration audio—even when the sound category was not known at the time of algorithm training. We introduce a collection of open datasets designed to strongly test a system's ability to perform few-shot sound event detections, and we present the results of a public contest to address the task. Our analysis shows that prototypical networks are a very common used strategy and they perform well when enhanced with adaptations for general characteristics of animal sounds. However, systems with high time resolution capabilities perform the best in this challenge. We demonstrate that widely-varying sound event durations are an important factor in performance, as well as non-stationarity, i.e. gradual changes in conditions throughout the duration of a recording. For fine-grained bioacoustic recognition tasks without massive annotated training data, our analysis demonstrate that few-shot sound event detection is a powerful new method, strongly outperforming traditional signal-processing detection methods in the fully automated scenario. © 2023 The Authors",Bioacoustics; Deep learning; Event detection; Few-shot learning,Computer science,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Scopus

Extensive use of VAs has provided the large, cash-rich technology companies who sell them with another way of consuming users' data, providing a lucrative revenue stream. Whilst these companies are legally obliged to treat users' information ""fairly and responsibly,""artificial intelligence techniques used to process data have become incredibly sophisticated, leading to users' concerns that a lack of clarity is making it hard to understand the nature and scope of data collection and use.There has been little work undertaken on a self-contained user awareness tool targeting VAs. PrivExtractor, a novel web-based awareness dashboard for VA users, intends to redress this imbalance of understanding between the data ""processors""and the user. It aims to achieve this using the four largest VA vendors as a case study and providing a comparison function that examines the four companies' privacy practices and their compliance with data protection law.As a result of this research, we conclude that the companies studied are largely compliant with the law, as expected. However, the user remains disadvantaged due to the ineffectiveness of current data regulation that does not oblige the companies to fully and transparently disclose how and when they use, share, or profit from the data. Furthermore, the software tool developed during the research is, we believe, the first that is capable of a comparative analysis of VA privacy with a visual demonstration to increase ease of understanding for the user.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

These codes are implemented in specialized integrated circuits (ICs) that facilitate data transmission. However, the power requirements of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) circuits, which operate across a wide frequency range, present a significant challenge for future communication systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel multi-frequency power reduction strategy for LDPC encoders. The strategy utilizes dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), a well-established power reduction method in CMOS circuits. By combining DVFS with fuzzy logic control, the system optimizes the voltage supplied to the LDPC encoder, achieving substantial power reduction while maintaining coding efficiency, flexibility, and performance. The proposed approach dynamically adjusts the encoder's voltage levels based on real-time conditions, ensuring efficient power consumption across different frequencies. This innovative strategy aims to overcome the power challenges faced by future communication generations, which have been largely overlooked in previous research efforts. This paper aims to assess the effectiveness of a multi-frequency power reduction strategy for LDPC encoders. Through extensive analysis and evaluations, it demonstrates significant power reduction while maintaining LDPC coding efficiency. These findings contribute to the development of power-efficient LDPC encoder designs, meeting the evolving needs of communication systems. Results reveal the system's performance across different frequency ranges. In the lowfrequency range (1 MHz to 100 MHz), a remarkable 90% power reduction is achieved. In the medium-frequency range (100 MHz to 1 GHz), the reduction is 50%, while in the high-frequency range (1 GHz to 5 GHz), it reaches 20% to 14.5%. Notably, the system operates most effectively in the low and medium frequency range, providing substantial power savings. These results highlight the potential of the multi-frequency power reduction strategy for LDPC encoders in addressing power challenges across different frequencies. The significant power reduction achieved demonstrates its effectiveness and adaptability to varying frequency demands. This contributes to the development of power-efficient LDPC encoder designs, optimizing performance and energy consumption in various communication systems. © 2023, International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems.
